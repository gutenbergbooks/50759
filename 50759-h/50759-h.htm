  <h2 class='c011'><span class='c005'>GROCERS’ GOODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div><span class='c008'>A FAMILY GUIDE.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>In the ancient times of twenty-five or thirty years ago, the grocer’s
goods consisted chiefly of codfish, flour, sugar, tea, coffee,
salt, <a id='tn007'></a>molasses and whale oil. There were also a little candy in
glass jars, some nuts in bins, a few drums of figs and a box of sour
oranges. The grocer himself found plenty of time to talk politics
and play checkers across the counter with his friends and neighbors.
Those were the days when a few conservative old
merchants used to meet and discuss the tea market and allot
among themselves the quantity to be imported, not a pound of
which could arrive under twelve or fifteen months.</p>

<p class='c021'>But things have changed. The importer now flashes his order
under the sea and on, over plains and through jungles to China.
“Ocean tramp” steamships are waiting to receive his merchandise,
and within thirty or forty days it may be sending up its
grateful fragrance from tea tables in the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>THE MODERN GROCER.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Nor has the enterprising retail grocer of to-day failed to catch
the spirit of this progress and keep even step with it. He has
become the Popular Food Provider, and his store represents
about everything which is palatable in either hemisphere or any
zone. As the world has grown enlightened and refined, his
stock has become more and more varied and better adapted to
the wants of mankind, until it embraces every delicacy of the
land, sea or air.</p>

<p class='c021'>His cunningly prepared sauces provoke the appetite and give
zest to more substantial articles, while they help also to digest
them. He has food fitted for the intellectual worker and for the
laborer, for the invalid and for the infant. He practically annihilates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the seasons and furnishes fruits and vegetables in mid-winter,
as fresh and delicate as when first plucked from their
native stems or vines. And, moreover, all the goods upon his
sightly shelves are now put up in the most attractive, portable
and convenient form for family use.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Food Never Before so Low.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Nor would a day’s wages ever before purchase so much of food
products. In the English market, for the ten years from 1870 to
1880, the price of wheat was forty-three per cent. higher than
the average of 1886. Sugars have fallen in price nearly one-half
in ten years, and teas, coffee, and many other articles are proportionately
low.</p>

<p class='c021'>This is due to improvements in machinery, increased transportation
facilities and the opening up of new and fertile sections of
the earth, under all of which the world’s supply of food has of
late years been greatly in excess of the world’s increase in population;
and it is the grocer who brings these advantages home to
our families.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Food Adulteration.</h3>

<p class='c023'>There has long been an uneasy feeling lest many articles of
food and drink were not only mixed with substances which reduced
their nutritive value, but were also often colored with
cumulative poisons, and adulterated with substances injurious
to health.</p>

<p class='c021'>These fears have not been altogether groundless. There can
be no doubt that this monstrous crime has been practiced to some
extent in respect to certain articles. But, thanks to the diffusion
of intelligence, the teachings of science, the operation of law, the
fear of detection and punishment, and largely, also, by the
refusal of conscientious grocers to sell such unwholesome
products; greedy and unscrupulous manufacturers have been
compelled to abandon their vicious practices, and noxious food
adulteration is now comparatively a rare crime.</p>

<p class='c021'>Those who desire pure articles can almost always obtain them
of a reputable grocer by paying their value. But in order to
supply the demand for cheaper goods and meet competition, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>articles as powdered spices, etc., are extensively prepared, mixed
with harmless substances, and containing the largest quantity of
pure material which can be furnished at the price for which they
are sold. Perhaps, also, such articles are more economical in the
using, and admixtures are sometimes improvements.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Adulteration Laws.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Yet even this class of adulterated goods is objectionable, from
the fact that there are always dealers who will be tempted to sell
them as “Strictly pure,” thus defrauding the purchaser, out-reaching
honest rivals and losing their own self-respect. Probably,
therefore, most of the upright and leading grocers of the
country would be glad to see wise and effective general laws
passed against food adulterations, under which all could unite
and be freed from unfair competition by the unscrupulous. But
laws which will protect both the health and the pocket are
difficult to frame and to execute without being sumptuary and
oppressive. The most effectual and probably the best laws of the
kind in this country at present are the enactments of Massachusetts,
New York, Ohio, New Jersey, and Michigan.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Less Adulteration than Commonly Supposed.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The general Government is also moving in the matter. Last
year (1887) three “Bulletins” were issued at Washington, which
deal exhaustively with current adulterations of dairy products,
spices, etc., and fermented beverages. These reports, made under
direction of the Commissioner of Agriculture, were prepared
respectively by Messrs. H. W. Wiley, C. Richardson, and C. A.
Crampton, who state in substance that they found certain articles
extensively adulterated, but generally with harmless materials.</p>

<p class='c021'>The president of the N. Y. Microscopical Society states that
many members of that scientific body have looked into the
alleged adulterations of food products and find them not as
general as many suppose, and the adulterants found were in most
cases harmless.</p>

<p class='c021'>At the recent “Health Exhibition,” in England, Dr. Jas.
Bell declared to the Conference, that, “In most articles of food
there has been a very great improvement in recent years as regards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>adulterations,” and that the “gross and deleterious adulterants
formerly used have been practically abandoned.” This accords
also with the recently expressed opinions of the eminent Dr. Hassall
and of many scientific investigators in this country.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Hints to Housekeepers.</h3>

<p class='c023'>As a rule, whole or unground articles are to be preferred to
those which are powdered; not only because they are less liable
to adulteration, but also because the latter more quickly lose
flavor and strength.</p>

<p class='c021'>This objection applies also to buying goods in large quantities
of wholesale dealers, for family use. This plan may appear to be
economical, but is generally disadvantageous both to buyer and
seller. Tea, aromatic and ground goods, and many other commodities
often deteriorate in quality before they are used. Servants
who can dip their hands into abundant supplies are apt to
become more wasteful. If articles so purchased do not prove
suitable, it is more trouble to exchange them than with the retail
dealer who sells in smaller quantities and is in daily contact with
his customers. And, besides, an honest man who studies the
daily wants of the families of his community, and adapts his
business to supplying them with good articles in convenient
quantities and at fair prices, has a right to expect consideration
and encouragement from his friends and neighbors.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>The Daily Food of a Model Man.</h3>

<p class='c023'>A healthy man, weighing, say, one hundred and fifty-four
pounds, consists of water one hundred and nine pounds, and of
solid matter forty-five pounds. His blood weighs about twelve
pounds, or, when dry, two pounds. The quantity of food substances
he should consume every day, and their relative proportions
necessary to keep him vigorous and well, are stated by
Prof. Johnston to be about as follows:</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Variety in Food.</h3>

<p class='c023'>If any constituent is deficient we must supply it; hence variety
in food is not only agreeable but necessary to health. Albumen,
fibrin, casein and gluten build up the muscles and tissues, while
starch, sugar and fat produce the warmth and energy of the body.

bones. Grains, fruits and vegetables contain starch and sugar
and more or less gluten; meats contain fibrin and albumen; milk,
casein, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'>This shows that the main difference between beef and bread is
that the meat contains no starch, and nearly three times as much

<p class='c021'>These are average analyses. The casein is equivalent to
the gluten of vegetables or the fibrin of meat, and the sugar to
starch.</p>

<p class='c021'>With these few general observations, let us pass on to consider
in detail the Grocer’s Goods.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>THE CEREALS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c022'>WHEAT.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The cereal grains consist of solidified vegetable milk, drawn from
the bosom of Mother Earth. But two of them all are used for making
light and spongy bread with yeast, and wheat has the
universal preference because it contains all the elements necessary
to the growth and sustenance of the body. It makes bread
which is more inviting to the eye and more agreeable to the
taste. It is the highest type of vegetable food known to mankind,
and it is claimed that the most enlightened nations of
modern times owe their mental and bodily superiority to this
great and beneficent product.</p>

<p class='c021'>There is little if any difference in the nutriment or value of
spring and winter wheat. Some prefer the one and some the
other. Southern raised wheat is apt to be drier than northern
and will better stand the effects of warm climates. Wheat varies
in weight per bushel as the season is wet or dry. The best is
round, plump and smooth. It contains about fifteen parts of
water, sixty-five to seventy-five parts of starch, and about ten
parts of gluten. The average annual production of wheat in the
United States during the past eight years has been 448,815,699
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>bushels; an increase over the preceding ten years of forty-four
per cent., while the increase of population has been only twenty-five
per cent.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Wheaten Flour.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Wheat was formerly ground by mill stones, and the product
bolted and sifted into the different grades. But during the last
twelve years, this process has been largely superseded by the
“Patent Roller” process of crushing and separating the flour
from the bran. This is a great improvement over the old method;
more flour is obtained from the wheat, and it is whiter, contains
more gluten, and is therefore stronger.</p>

<p class='c021'>The first consideration is the color or whiteness; second, the
quantity of gluten the flour contains. The eye determines the
first, and a hasty test of the quantity and quality of the gluten
may be made by squeezing some of the flour into a lump in the
hand. This lump will more closely show the prints of the fingers,
and will hold its form in handling with considerable more
tenacity if the flour is good, than if it is inferior and deficient
in gluten.</p>

<p class='c021'>Grocers and bakers test flour by smoothing a little out on a
board with a knife or paper cutter, to see its color, and if it contains
specks of bran, etc., which may show that it has not been
well bolted or “dressed.” To determine the quantity and
strength of the gluten, they mix some of the flour with water,
and judge by the tenacity of the dough—the length to
which it may be drawn out by the fingers, or spread into a thin
sheet.</p>

<p class='c021'>Injury to flour is shown most quickly in the gluten, which may
lose its vitality. The gluten of good flour will swell to several
times its bulk under a gentle heat, and give off the pleasant odor
of hot bread, while the gluten from poor flour swells but little,
becomes viscous or nearly fluid, and smells disagreeably.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Points for Purchasers of Flour.</h3>

<p class='c023'>As starch is whiter than gluten, whiteness is therefore really
no indication of the sweetness and strength of flour; and,
although flour becomes whiter with age and will take up more
water and make a whiter loaf, many prefer freshly ground flour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>for family use, as being better in flavor, while others claim that
flour will “work better” if kept for some time after grinding.</p>

<p class='c021'>The brand or word “Patent” on packages of flour has come
to signify, not that the flour is really patented, but that it is or
should be finest quality. Fancy brands may mean little; they
are put on at the whim of the maker. Flour is rarely adulterated
at present, but good and poor grades are sometimes mixed.
Inferior grades of flour are largely exported, while the best are
mainly used at home. Graham flour is ground wheat from which
the bran has not been removed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Flour is put up in barrels of one hundred and ninety-six pounds
net weight, and in muslin sacks of various weights. Families
everywhere invariably want “the best,” and dealers often adopt
the excellent plan of buying quantities of some very choice and
tried grade of flour and selling it in convenient sized packages

<h3 class='c022'>Corn or Maize.</h3>

<p class='c023'>This is one of the most beautiful of plants, and the Indians formerly
ascribed to it a Divine origin. Hiawatha watched by the
grave of the Spirit Mondamin,</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Indian corn contains more oil or fat than any of the common
cereals. It will make as white and fine flour as wheat, but this
does not make good fermented bread, unless mixed with wheaten
flour. <span class='sc'>Corn Meal</span> is healthful, nutritious and cheap, but, owing
to its fat, is prone to attract oxygen and spoil, especially in warm
weather. There are two kinds, one <span class='fss'>WHITE</span>, the other <span class='fss'>GOLDEN
YELLOW</span>. They are equally nutritious, and about the same in
price. Some prefer the one and some the other, but probably the
yellow is rather the most popular. The starch extracted from
corn is very extensively used throughout the country, and such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>leading brands of <span class='fss'>CORN STARCH</span> as those of Kingsford, Duryea,
etc., are well known. In fact, the consumption of all the products
of corn is enormous.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Samp</span> is corn deprived of its skin and eye and left whole or
cracked in halves. <span class='sc'>Hominy</span> is corn ground or cracked into
coarse, medium or fine grains, and pearled or polished. <span class='sc'>Dried
Corn</span>, largely prepared by the Shakers, is sweet corn boiled and
dried. It is excellent and much used as a vegetable.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Rye Flour.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Rye ranks next to wheat for bread making, and is equally
nutritious. It yields less flour and more bran than wheat, contains
more sugar, and is darker in color. Its gluten has less tenacity
and it will not make as light and spongy bread as wheat flour,
hence is little used in this country. Rye flour should contain a
little of the bran, as this has a pleasant, aromatic flavor. The
“Black bread,” so extensively eaten in portions of Europe, is
made of rye flour. It is dark, heavy and sourish, but like all
rye bread, has the property of keeping moist a long time. Two
parts of wheat with one of rye flour makes wholesome and palatable
bread.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Barley.</h3>

<p class='c023'>This grain is less nutritious and less digestible than wheat, but
contains more sugar and more of the phosphates, and is also
cooling. It will not make good bread, but is sometimes used for
the purpose, mixed with wheaten flour.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Pearl Barley</span> is the whole grain freed from its hulls like
rice. It is used in soups, etc., and is sold by all grocers. In the
best qualities the grains are large and well rounded. It is sold
in bulk and in pound packages.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Oatmeal.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Oats are substantial, nutritious and wholesome, being rich in
gluten and fat. Oatmeal for the table is made from kiln dried,
large, white oats, freed from the husks. Alone it does not make
good bread. If long used as a sole or chief food it is reputed
to overtax the digestive organs, heat the blood, and produce eruptions
of the skin. Many claim, however, that these effects are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>due solely to insufficient cooking of the meal or porridge, and
there are excellent preparations in market which have been well
cooked by steam and afterwards dried.</p>

<p class='c021'>Besides these there are various brands of Scotch, Irish, Canadian
and American oatmeal, “Crushed,” “Rolled,” “Granulated,”
etc., also oat “<span class='sc'>Avena</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Farina</span>,” etc. <span class='sc'>Groats</span> are the whole
kernels of oats deprived of their husks. The consumption of
oatmeal has vastly increased within five or six years, and is rapidly
becoming universal. Salt only <i>after</i> cooking. If added
before, salt tends to harden the meal and prevent its swelling.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Buckwheat.</h3>

<p class='c023'>This grain may be classed with wheat as regards its nutritive
qualities. It contains thirteen or fourteen per cent. of water,
about fifteen per cent. of gluten, and sixty or sixty-five per cent.
of starch. It will not make good fermented bread, but its delicious
cakes are an essential and attractive feature upon American
breakfast tables everywhere, especially in cool weather. It is
sold in bulk and is also put up in three and six pound packages.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Rice.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Although this grain is the main food of one-third of the human
race and is very easily digested, it contains too little gluten and
fat and too much starch to be considered alone as a perfect food
for man. Rice has a slightly constipating effect but is an excellent
and wholesome occasional article of diet, and one which
could not well be spared from the family list. Rice is sold deprived
of its husk. It is imported from the East Indies, but the
best is the fine, large head rice of the Carolinas. As some of the
most valuable qualities of rice dissolve out in hot water, it should
be steamed until tender, rather than boiled.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Farinaceous Foods.</h3>

<p class='c023'>These are very numerous and some of them are excellent.
Among them may be named the “<span class='fss'>CEREALINE FLAKES</span>,” made
from white corn; <span class='fss'>CRACKED</span> and <span class='fss'>CRUSHED WHEAT</span>, <span class='fss'>WHEATEN GRITS</span>,
<span class='fss'>FARINA</span>, which is the inner part of the wheat granulated, <span class='fss'>SELF-RAISING</span><a id='tn016'></a>,
<span class='fss'>BUCKWHEAT</span> and other <span class='fss'>FLOURS</span>; “<span class='fss'>WHEATLET</span>,” “<span class='fss'>GRAINLET</span>,”
“<span class='fss'>GRANUM</span>,” “<span class='fss'>FARINOSE</span>,” “<span class='fss'>MAIZENA</span>,” <span class='fss'>MANIOCA</span>, <span class='fss'>INFANT</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><span class='fss'>FOOD</span>, <span class='fss'>MILK FOOD</span>, <span class='fss'>ARROW ROOT</span>, <span class='fss'>CORN STARCH</span> of various makes,
<span class='fss'>GRAHAM FLOUR</span>, <span class='fss'>BOSTON BROWN BREAD MIXTURES</span>, etc. Many of
these preparations are eaten with milk, and prove valuable additions
to the family diet.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Sago</span> is the pith of an Indian palm steeped in water until it
becomes a paste, then formed into little balls by rubbing it through
a perforated plate. The best is the whitest. <span class='sc'>Tapioca</span> is the pith
of the Manihot tree, washed like sago, but granulated differently.
Both are nutritious and easily digested, and are made into puddings,
often with fruit, and eaten with milk or sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Bread.</h3>

<p class='c023'>One hundred pounds of good, fine, wheaten flour will take up
forty-five pounds of water, and yield one hundred and forty-five
pounds of bread. The proper and legal weight of bread is while
it is hot. A four pound loaf loses in twenty-four hours one and
one-quarter ounces; in forty-eight hours five ounces; in seventy
hours nine ounces. The quantity of water which flour will absorb
depends largely on the proportion and quality of the gluten.
The best flours absorb most, and will take up more in dry than
in wet seasons; hence a dry season is good for the baker. Thorough
kneading increases the absorption of water, and should be
continued until none of the dough will stick to the hand.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Feed for Stock.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Among the articles largely used as food for animals are the
refuse products of the various grains made in preparing them for
human consumption; as, for instance, the refuse left in the pearling
of barley, or in making hominy and samp; dried <span class='sc'>Barley
Sprouts</span> from malt, low grade flour; <span class='sc'>Middlings</span>, which are a
mixture of bran and flour; <span class='sc'>Bran</span>, etc. Besides these, <span class='sc'>Oats</span>,
white, black and mixed, and vast quantities of Southern and
Western <span class='sc'>Corn</span> are also used for stock, ground into coarse meal.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Bread Raising Materials.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Fermentation, says Liebig, is not only the simplest and best,
but likewise the most economical way of making light and porous
bread.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Yeast</span> is a true fungous plant, which has the power of establishing
fermentation and changing starch into sugar, and the
escaping gas makes the loaf light and spongy. Hops prevent too
great fermentation and impart an agreeable flavor. <span class='sc'>Brewers’
Yeast</span> is largely used when obtainable, and there are many domestic
modes of preparing yeast from potatoes, flour, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dried Yeast.</span>—But as all these fresh yeasts are liable to spoil
and affect the bread unpleasantly, there is an extensive demand
for a yeast which shall possess the same properties and which
may be kept a long time. Hence, the various brands of yeast
cakes sold by the grocer. They are made usually by adding corn
meal to the yeast and carefully drying the cakes in the sun. It is
singular that a fall or sudden jar may injure yeast cakes and deprive
them largely of their qualities.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cream of tartar</span>, <span class='fss'>BI-CARBONATE OF SODA</span>, <span class='fss'>BI-CARBONATE OF
POTASH</span> (<span class='fss'>SALERATUS</span>), are all used in bread making, and are to be
had in all sorts of packages of the grocer. Cream of tartar is
tartrate of potash, and is made from the argols found incrusted
upon the inside of wine barrels. It should be white, and not yellowish
in tint. The effect of these chemicals in raising bread is
due chiefly to the liberation of the carbonic acid gas they contain
when mixed with water, incorporated with the dough and put in
the oven, and the great requisite is that they should be pure and
unadulterated.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Baking Powders</span> are much used for making light and palatable
domestic biscuits, etc. They are convenient, and generally
lessen the quantity of shortening required. They are made chiefly of
tartaric acid and bi-carbonate of soda, and should be neutral to
the taste, and without effervescence if either an acid or alkali is
added. One popular variety, called “Phosphatic Baking Powder,”
consists of acid phosphate of lime instead of cream of tartar,
with soda.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Biscuits, Crackers, etc.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The word biscuit means twice baked, and is a survival from the
ancient mode of cooking the cakes which is now no longer in use.
Plain biscuits are said to be more nutritious than bread in the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of five to three, and are most digestible when light and
well browned in baking, so as to turn much of the starch into
dextrine. Sea biscuit or ship bread is made simply of flour and
water baked at a high heat. In the large cracker bakeries the
dough is mixed, rolled and cut by machinery and the cakes travel
on through patent ovens until baked, when they drop out into
baskets. Those made by hand are, however, considered best.</p>

<p class='c021'>The variety of biscuits and crackers in market is utterly bewildering.
These are among the standards: <span class='sc'>Boston</span>, <span class='fss'>SODA</span>, <span class='fss'>BUTTER</span>,
<span class='fss'>OYSTER</span>, <span class='fss'>SUGAR</span>, <span class='fss'>FRUIT</span>, <span class='fss'>MILK</span>, <span class='fss'>ENGLISH ALBERT</span>, <span class='fss'>WATER</span>, <span class='fss'>CREAM</span>,
<span class='fss'>GINGER</span>, <span class='fss'>LEMON</span>, <span class='fss'>OATMEAL</span>, <span class='fss'>CARAWAY</span>, <span class='fss'>VANILLA</span>, and dozens more
kinds of biscuits, crackers and wafers at various prices; besides
<span class='fss'>GINGER</span> and <span class='fss'>LEMON SNAPS</span> and <span class='fss'>JUMBLES</span>, and even <span class='fss'>DOG BISCUIT</span>.
There is also <span class='fss'>CRACKER DUST</span>, for frying oysters, fish, etc. Some
of the above come in handsome tin packages.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Maccaroni</span>, <a id='tn019'></a><span class='fss'>VERMICELLI</span>, <span class='sc'>Spaghetti</span>.—These are all made from
the dough of the hardest and most glutenous Southern wheat, and
the domestic are inferior to the Italian or French. The best will
merely swell and soften after long boiling, and still retain its form.
Maccaroni is in small tubes, spaghetti in small stems, and vermicelli
in threads or shreds. Letters, stars, and other figures are
also made from the same material or paste; all are largely used in
soups. <span class='sc'>Egg noodles</span> are ribbon maccaroni.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>SUGAR AND THE SWEETS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>This necessity of modern life ranks as one of the most important
articles among the grocers’ goods. Two hundred years ago
it was sold chiefly by the apothecaries, but is now consumed in
all parts of the world to the extent of many millions of tons annually.
Sugars have been divided into four kinds, viz.: cane sugar,
found in stems; grape sugar, found in fruits; manna sugar, found
in leaves; and milk or animal sugar.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are many varieties of the sugar cane which contain from
twelve to twenty per cent. of sugar; these are cut, crushed, and
the juice boiled down and clarified with lime, etc.; the sugar
crystallizes and leaves the molasses. The sugar beet contains from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>seven to thirteen per cent. of sugar, which, when raw, is unpleasant,
but when refined is identical with cane sugar. The fact that
the molasses of the sugar beet, although colorless, is very <a id='tn020'></a>disagreeable,
has retarded the beet sugar manufacture, but it is a great and
growing industry. The sap of the sugar maple contains about
two per cent. of <span class='fss'>MAPLE SUGAR</span>, which is identical with cane sugar,
and may be made white, but is preferred brown, as containing
more of the rich maple flavor. About seven thousand tons of
maple sugar are annually made in the New England States. <span class='sc'>Maple
syrup</span> is extensively sold by grocers in cans, bottles, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Grape sugar or glucose.</span>—The sweetness of ripe fruits is due
to the starch which they contain, passing, under the ripening influence
of nature, into grape sugar. Substances may consist of
the same elements, but different proportions may greatly vary their
properties. For instance, starch and sugar consist merely of carbon
and water. Grape sugar contains more water than starch,
and cane sugar more than grape sugar.</p>

<p class='c021'>Now, long boiling of starch in pure water produces little change
upon it; but it was found that if a little sulphuric acid is added,
the starch will take up more water and become entirely converted
into grape sugar. And this is substantially the way in which
commercial glucose is made. The acid is neutralized by lime,
and the liquor boiled down into solid grape sugar or syrup.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cane Sugars</span> are sweeter than grape sugars in the proportion
of five to three; hence, three pounds of cane sugar are worth five
pounds of grape or starch sugar for sweetening purposes. This
is the reason why grape sugar is used to adulterate cane sugar, and
it is the only adulterant used at present to any extent.</p>

<p class='c021'>One pound of water will dissolve three pounds of cane, but only
one pound of grape sugar. The latter has a gummy taste on the
tongue and dissolves slowly. A small grained sugar may carry
some glucose and perhaps escape detection, but the crystals of a
large grained sugar will always be brilliant in contrast with its
contaminating ingredients, and thus proclaim the fraud. In other
words, inferior sugars have a dull look, while good sugars are
bright. Glucose sugars melt at one hundred and five degrees,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>C., while cane sugars melt only when heated to one hundred
and thirty-seven degrees, C. Raw sugars are no longer
used. They should be refined to free them from the repulsive
sugar mite and other impurities. The best sugar is always the
most economical.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Best Grades of Family Sugar</span> are the cut loaf, cubes
and crushed. Next in market value, in the order in which they
stand, are powdered, granulated, A sugars, C sugars, white, yellow,
extra golden, etc., down to common yellow.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Syrups.</span>—These are the uncrystallized residue in refining brown
sugars. They are diluted, filtered through animal charcoal, and
concentrated. The lighter the color the higher the price.
The better qualities are called “Rock Candy Drips,” “Golden
Drips,” etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Molasses.</span>—The choicest are the New Orleans Fancy, Choice,
Prime. Good, etc., down through the same grades of Porto Rico,
to the Cuba Muscovado. The quality of molasses has deteriorated
with improvements in the manufacture of sugar on plantations,
and it is sometimes sold mixed with glucose.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Honey.</span>—Consists of eighty parts in a hundred of pure grape
sugar with an acid and aromatic principle. Spring honey is better
than that made in autumn, and that from clover or other fragrant
flowers is better than that of buckwheat.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Sugar Candies.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Whatever dangers may have lurked in confectionery in times
past, parents may now be assured that they can gratify the natural
and healthy appetite of their children for sweets, without
fear of poisonous colorings or harmful adulterants.</p>

<p class='c021'>The “National Confectioners’ Association,” (an organization
formed by a large proportion of the leading manufacturing confectioners
of the United States,) “is pledged by its constitution
and by-laws to prosecute all parties using poisonous colorings,
terra-alba, or other mineral substances in the manufacture of confectionery.”
They invite fathers and others interested to report
any supposed case of injury from eating poisoned candy, and
“offer a reward of one hundred dollars for evidence that will enable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>them to convict the offender.” It is the opinion of the
editor of the <i>Weekly Confectioner</i>, and of many prominent manufacturing
confectioners in New York, as expressed to us, that in
all the land there is now no product of domestic manufacture and
consumption which is more free from poisonous colorings and injurious
adulterants than confectionery.</p>

<p class='c021'>But more than this: in 1886 this association passed an amendment
to its constitution forbidding any member, under penalty of
expulsion, to buy or sell “any candy adulterated with flour, corn
meal, starch, or cerealine, except such amount of starch as is
necessary to the manufacture of gum goods and fig paste work.”
Many confectioners, however, think this action was ill advised.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Making Candy, etc.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Glucose or grape sugar now enters largely into the manufacture
of many kinds of confectionery, and harmless vegetable colors
are used. Manipulation breaks up the crystals of sugar and
thereby renders it whiter, and the difference in the price of candies
is now largely due to the amount of manipulation it receives.
Few have an idea of the vast quantities of confectionery manufactured.
It amounts to many hundred tons daily; much of it is
made almost entirely by machinery, and the business is divided.
For instance, one firm makes only lozenges, another gum drops,
caramels or licorice, marshmellow, etc. Jobbers supply retailers.</p>

<p class='c021'>If synthetic or chemically prepared flavoring extracts are used,
they are such only as are guaranteed harmless.</p>

<p class='c021'>French imported “Bon Bons” are still superior to the domestic,
and so are their candied violets; but rose leaves iced here
are equal to the imported. Licorice candies are having an increased
demand yearly. Cocoanut candy contains usually a large
admixture of the harmless cerealine. Space will not permit
more than a reference to the great variety of confections in market.
Among them are stick and lump candies in scallops and
patties, with mottoes, etc., assorted and in various colors; mixed
candies in various forms and flavors, gum drops, lozenges, white,
red and assorted; rock candies, etc.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>FAMILY BEVERAGES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c022'>TEA.</h3>

<p class='c023'>This staple necessity of modern life is now consumed by more
than five hundred millions of people, and its use appears to grow
with the growth of civilization. There is but one species of the
tea plant and its varieties are due to differences of soil and climate.
China alone produces annually nearly a million and a half
tons of tea; to say nothing of the teas of Japan, Corea, Assam,
and Java.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Effects of Tea.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Tea exhilarates without intoxicating; rouses the mind to increased
activity without reaction, while at the same time it soothes
the body, dispels headache, and counteracts the effects of fermented
liquors and narcotics. It lessens also the waste of the
tissues under the labors of life.</p>

<p class='c021'>As an English authority says: “When the time has arrived to
the old and infirm, that the stomach can no longer digest enough
of the ordinary elements of food to keep up the waste of the
system, and the size and weight of the body begins to diminish,
tea comes in as a medicine to arrest this loss of tissue.” No wonder
then that the aged, the infirm and the poor should take kindly
to tea. If supplies of food are scanty it lessens the need for
them, while it makes them feel more light and cheerful, and contributes
to their enjoyment.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Black and Green Teas.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Either may be prepared at will from the same leaves; the difference
lies in the mode of treatment. The earliest leaves are the
tenderest and best flavored; later gatherings grow more woody
and bitter. Black teas are spread in the air for some time after
gathering, then roasted and rolled by hand, again exposed to the
air, whereby they undergo a slight degree of fermentation, and
finally are dried slowly over charcoal fires. The leaves for green
tea are, as soon as gathered, roasted a few minutes in pans over a
brisk fire, after which they are carefully rolled and thoroughly
dried.</p>

<p class='c021'>The aroma and commercial value of tea are due to a small
quantity, (from 1/4 to 1 per cent.) of a volatile oil which it contains.
This oil, as in coffee, is developed by roasting, the fresh picked
leaves having neither an astringent, aromatic, nor bitter taste.
But the effects of tea are due to its theine and tannin. Theine is
present in all kinds of tea, as well as in coffee and cocoa, but it has
no flavor. Tannin forms from a fifth to a seventh of the weight of
the dried tea leaf, and is the more completely extracted the longer
the tea is infused, or “draws.” Its precise effect upon the system
is not fully known. Black tea contains less theine, essential oil,
and tannin, than green tea.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Chinese pour hot water upon their tea, and drink it
clear, and in Russia a squeeze of lemon takes the place of our
cream. The Chinese sometimes flavor their fine teas with the cowslip
colored blossoms of the sweet-scented olive and other odoriferous
plants; and they also adulterate them with foreign or
exhausted tea leaves, or with tea dust, called “Lie tea.” But
good authorities declare that fair grades of tea are not now much
or necessarily adulterated, and that the old idea that green teas
are colored or faced with copper is erroneous; at least experts
have not been able to detect even traces of it.</p>

<p class='c023'>There are tea coloring and facing establishments in this country
which use for the purpose substances very similar to those used by
the Chinese, and they have become so expert of late years that
they can turn a black tea into a green (or <i>vice versa</i>) at short notice.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Tea buyers judge quality by the aroma, flavor, and the color
and strength of the infusion. They detect vegetable adulterations
by the shape and size of the leaf when unrolled, and sometimes
burn the leaves and weigh the residue of ash.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Gunpowder, Hyson, and Imperial.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Some of the most experienced tea dealers in New York declare
that there is really no essential difference in the quality of the
“Firsts” or choicest grades of any “Chop” of either Gunpowder,
Hyson, or Imperial, the only difference being in the form or fineness
of granulation. But the popular preference in green tea is for
Gunpowder, which is believed to consist of the first leaves or leaf
buds of the plant. It is graded from “common” or “fair” up to
“choicest.”</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Varieties of Tea.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Hyson is a widely used green tea. The name is derived from
He-chun, a noted Chinese tea grower. Young Hyson is said to be
made from the earlier leaves; Imperials and Hysons from later
gatherings. Hyson skin is the light inferior leaves winnowed
out. Twankay is the poorest of the green, as Bohea is of the
black teas. Pekoe is the best of black teas, but is little used,
except to give fragrance to mixtures. “Capers” is used similarly
to flavor green teas. Congou (made with care) and Souchong are
good black teas, and are the so-called “English Breakfast Teas.”
Moyune teas are considered as among the best and healthiest of
green teas, while Pingsuys are inferior. Cheap teas are most
adulterated. Fine teas are not only better in flavor, but are
stronger and go further.</p>

<p class='c021'>Oolong teas have “the call” in popularity with the Americans
just now and they are recommended in sickness by the best
physicians. There are three kinds, the Formosa, Foo Chow,
and Amoy. The first two are the best. An article in the <i>London
Daily News</i>, of February 18, 1888, avers that the Chinese are
growing neglectful in cultivating, firing, and fermenting their
teas, and that Japan is stealing away the green tea trade of China,
as India and Ceylon are taking that in black tea.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Japan Teas.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>A. &amp; A. Low, of New York, imported the first cargo of Japan
tea about twenty years ago, and since then its consumption has
constantly increased. The natural leaf is yellowish brown, and
the first Japan teas brought here were of that color. But the tint
has changed. The “uncolored” Japan tea is in fact now all
colored with some substance like the Chinese green teas, but not
injuriously. The “Basket fired” is the nearest to the uncolored
leaf. The “Sun-dried” is very popular here, and is but slightly
colored. Expert tea tasters declare that Japan teas are more exciting
to the nerves than those from China.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Blended Teas.</h3>

<p class='c023'>New crop teas are the best. Japan teas come in June, and
Chinese later, say in July and August. Many prefer a mixture of
green and black tea for family use, and retail dealers often have
the knack of so blending the two that the excellence of each is
enhanced. Such a combination has less effect upon the nerves,
and is less expensive than good green tea, while it may be more
delightful in flavor than either black or green tea alone.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>COFFEE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Coffee has been aptly called the “Beverage of Intelligence.” It
quickens the functions of the brain, arouses all the intellectual
faculties, stimulates and gives clearness to thought and increases
the powers of judgment. It exhilarates the nervous system,
counteracts the stupor caused by fatigue, by disease, or by opium,
allays hunger, retards the waste of the tissues, fortifies the powers
of endurance, and to a certain extent gives to the weary and exhausted
increased strength and vigor, and a feeling of comfort
and repose.</p>

<p class='c021'>Both tea and coffee are more and more used in proportion to the
intellectual development of modern times. But coffee does not
excite the nervous system as greatly as tea and there is less reaction
after it.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Coffee Better than Alcohol.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Coffee tends to lessen the desire for alcoholic drinks, and possesses
some of their properties without their bad effects. Alcohol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>is a false and dangerous friend. Its free use enfeebles the vital
organs, reduces the power of resistance, degrades the mind and
body and leads on to poverty, disease, and death. Coffee produces
the beneficial effects of moderate doses of alcohol, without
its injurious effects. It does not, like alcohol, destroy the nerves,
or invite immoderation, and even when used to excess is incapable
of doing serious injury.</p>

<p class='c021'>The most temperate countries are those which consume most
coffee, and in the light of all these facts it would appear that
efforts to extend and increase the use of coffee tend to check or
diminish alcoholism.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Coffee Growth and Production.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Coffee plants are raised from the seed, are set out in 12 months,
450 plants to the acre, begin to bear in 4 years, mature in 7
years, and continue for 40 years. The flowers are white and
fragrant; the fruit, which grows in clusters, resembles a red cherry
and contains two seeds, which are the coffee of commerce.</p>

<p class='c021'>The world’s total annual production of coffee is about 666,000
tons, of which Brazil furnishes 360,000 tons. The entire population
of the United States averages to consume, per capita 7-42/100 lbs.
of coffee yearly, more than three-quarters of which comes from
Brazil.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Raw Coffee</span>, unlike tea, improves in quality with age, while
it shrinks in weight, and inferior coffees may in time equal the
choicest varieties. The aroma is in the direct ratio of its drying
by keeping. Inferior coffees are uneven, often unclean. The
large, uniform, dense, heavy grains are preferred, as showing complete
maturity and careful selection. The color varies from all
shades of yellow to tints of brown, green, and bluish green.
There are large establishments in one or more eastern cities, which
assort, color, and polish raw coffees. Much Brazilian coffee is
assorted and sold for Mocha, Java, etc. Real Mocha is small,
round, and dark yellow; Java and East Indian is larger and of a
paler yellow. Ceylon, Brazilian and West Indian have naturally
a bluish green or greenish grey tint.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Roasting</span> is necessary to develop the aroma and goodness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of coffee. This delicate operation changes its chemical
composition and develops the caffeine and volatile oil. If
roasted too little the coffee retains a raw taste; if too much, a
part is changed to charcoal and much aroma lost. The outside
may be burned and the inside left raw, or some grains may be
half raw and others burned. Coffee loses in weight from 15 to
20 and even 25 per cent., and gains in bulk from 30 to 60 per
cent., according as it is roasted to a reddish, chestnut, or dark
brown. The best roasting is that which reduces the weight
about sixteen per cent., or to a light chestnut brown.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Coffee and Tea Compared.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Tea yields, weight for weight, twice as much caffeine (or
theine) as coffee; but as we use more in weight of the latter, a
cup of coffee contains about as much caffeine as a cup of tea.
The composition of roasted coffee and the tea leaf are given as
follows, although the proportions are variable:</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Modes of Making Coffee.</h3>

<p class='c023'>One pound of the properly roasted bean or berry should make
55 or 60 cups of good coffee. Coffee may be made too bitter, but
it is impossible to make it too fragrant. Coffee is much the best
when freshly ground. The French and many Americans merely
steep or infuse their coffee at a temperature just below the boiling
point, claiming that boiling dissipates the aroma; others bring
it only to a boil; while others still, hold that boiling it a
little is more economical, as giving an increased quantity of the
soluble, exhilarating and bitter principles. Soft water is best for
coffee, and coffee is better cold than warmed over, as it then loses
its fragrance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Coffee Substitutes and Adulterations.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Rye, beans, peas, acorns, carrots, turnips, dandelion root,
burned bread, and many similar substances have at times been
used as substitutes or adulterants for coffee. But as none of them
contain caffeine or the volatile aromatic oil, they cannot serve
the same physiological principle. Ground coffee is extensively
adulterated, and mainly with the much cheaper</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Chicory or Wild Endive.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Roasting develops in this root an empyreumatic, volatile oil
which exercises upon the system some of the nerve-soothing,
hunger-staying effects of tea and coffee. A little chicory gives
as dark a color and as bitter a taste as a great deal of coffee. It
is not unwholesome unless taken in excess, when its effects are
bad. It is a poor substitute for coffee, but some <a id='tn029'></a>people seem
actually to prefer coffee which contains chicory.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Tests for Adulterations.</h3>

<p class='c023'>If ground coffee cakes in the paper, or when pinched by the
fingers, or if, when a little is put into water, a part sinks while
the rest swims, and the water becomes immediately discolored,
the coffee is probably adulterated. The more caking and discoloration,
the more chicory and the less value.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are numerous brands of ground coffee on the market, and
some of them are very popular and satisfactory. There are also
various kinds of “Extracts” and “Essences” of coffee, and even
humble chicory may sometimes be seen without disguise and
nicely put up in yellow papers.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Cocoa and Chocolate.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The theobroma tree grows in Central and South America. The
seeds of its fruit, which are about the size of almonds, are gently
roasted, deprived of their husks and ground to a paste. This is
<span class='sc'>Cocoa</span>. If this paste be mixed with sugar and flavored with vanilla,
bitter almonds, etc., it forms the well known, delicious, and
nourishing <span class='sc'>Chocolate</span>, which may either be eaten as a confection
or drank as a beverage. The husk, which forms about 10 per
cent. of the weight of the bean, is called “<span class='sc'>Shells</span>,” and used by
invalids and others for making a light and delicate infusion or tea.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The aroma of cocoa is due to an essential oil which is developed,
as with tea and coffee, by roasting. Its exhilarating principle,
theobromine, resembles theine. It contains a large percentage
of fat, is very rich and nutritious, and may be said to unite
in itself the inspiring properties of tea with the strength-giving
qualities of milk.</p>

<p class='c021'>Starch, as well as sugar, is sometimes added to cocoa and
chocolate by the manufacturers, and the practice is believed
to be justified, owing to their richness in oil and as better fitting
them for digestion. Cocoa is, however, also prepared free from
starch and deprived of a portion of its oil. There are many
preparations of chocolate and cocoa in market, and they embrace
all grades of purity, sweetness and price.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>DAIRY PRODUCTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c022'>Milk, Etc.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Milk is sophisticated by robbing it of its cream, or by adding
to it “The milk of the cow with the iron tail,” and by coloring it.
<span class='sc'>Cream</span> contains about 40 per cent. of fat and 55 per cent.
of water; <span class='fss'>SKIMMED MILK</span> is water, with sugar and caseine.
<span class='sc'>Whey</span> is merely a solution of milk sugar with a little albumen.
Milk is best and most plentiful in spring, and richer but less
abundant in dry seasons. The last milk drawn from the cow contains
most cream. <span class='sc'>Koumiss</span>, the use of which is rapidly increasing,
is well skimmed milk, treated with a lactic ferment for
30 or 40 hours. It is very easy of digestion. <span class='sc'>Condensed
milk</span> is ordinary milk evaporated so that three pints are reduced
to one. It soon spoils unless the air is excluded. <span class='sc'>Preserved
milk</span> in cans contains about one-third its weight of sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Butter.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Good, fresh butter, contains 84 to 88 parts of milk fat, 10 or
12 parts of moisture, and a little milk sugar, caseine and salt.
inferior butter may contain as much as 33 per cent. of water, or
buttermilk, and salt. The more buttermilk left in, the sooner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the butter grows rancid, while over-working tends to make it
soft and oily. The melting of butter changes its physical properties,
and long exposure to the air injures the best butter.</p>

<p class='c021'>Good butter is solid and of a grained texture, has a fine orange
yellow color and a pleasant aroma. It may comfort the curious
to know that its odor is due to a very little butyric acid, combined
with oxide of lipyle. To test the quantity of moisture, put a
little of the butter in a bottle, heat gently, and leave near the fire
for half an hour, when the butter will rise, leaving the water and
salt at the bottom. Two-thirds of all the butter made is colored.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Classification of Butter.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The New York Mercantile Exchange classification, which is
standard, is as follows: <span class='sc'>Eastern Creamery</span>, <span class='sc'>Sweet Cream
Creamery</span>, <span class='sc'>Dairy Butter</span>, <span class='sc'>Western Creamery</span>, <span class='sc'>Imitation
Creamery</span>, and <span class='sc'>Dairy</span>, also “<span class='sc'>Ladle</span>” and “<span class='sc'>Grease Butter</span>.”</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Creamery Butter</span> is the best. It is such as is made from the
cream obtained by setting the milk at the creamery, or by the
system known as “Cream gathering,” by which the farmer delivers
his cream to the creamery to be churned or made into butter.
Butter made under the former system, or from the milk, is better
than that made from the gathered cream. <span class='sc'>Sweet Cream
Creamery</span> is made from unfermented cream.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dairy Butter</span> is that which is made, salted, and packed by
the dairyman or farmer. Though often really excellent, it is
less uniform in quality, and therefore less reliable.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Ladle Butter.</span>—This is butter of all seasons, ages, and qualities,
collected by the dealer, in rolls, lumps, or packages, from the
farm houses, salted, or unsalted, as the case may be, and by him
reworked, resalted, colored, and packed.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Grades of Butter.</span>—The varieties are all graded again into
“Extras,” “Extra Firsts,” “Firsts,” “Seconds,” “Thirds,” etc.
“<span class='sc'>Extras</span>” are the choicest grades under each classification, and
must come up to the following standard. Flavor must be perfect
if fresh made, and fine if held; body perfect and uniform, color
good for the season when made, perfect and uniform; must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>properly salted, and in good and uniform packages. “<span class='sc'>Extra
Firsts</span><a id='tn032'></a>” must be a grade just below “Extras,” and fine butter;
good color, etc., etc. “<span class='sc'>Firsts</span>” must be clean and sweet,
sound and good. “<span class='sc'>Seconds</span>” must be fair throughout, may be
strong if held, on tops and sides of package. “Thirds” may be
off-flavored, etc. “Poor Butter” may be strong, and of all grades
below “Thirds” down to “Grease Butter.”</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Artificial Butter.</h3>

<p class='c023'>About 20 years ago a French chemist tried to imitate the
process which takes place when cows are underfed, and when,
therefore, the butter they yield is supplied from their own fat.
His aim was to make a substitute for butter for the poor, etc.,
which should be healthful, agreeable and cheap, and which
should keep a long time without becoming rancid. The man’s
name was Mege-Mouries, and he discovered <span class='sc'>Oleomargarine</span>. This
product has been, and is still extensively manufactured in the
United States, and is pronounced by some of the most eminent
and scientific men to be wholesome, nutritious and palatable.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Oleomargarine</span> is made from the fat of slaughtered cattle.
This is melted at a temperature of 150 deg. F., and the stearine
extracted. The “Oleo oil” which is left is now churned with
cream or milk, colored and salted.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Butterine</span> is made from oleo oil, neutral lard, and some butter.
These ingredients are churned with milk or cream, colored, salted
and packed in tubs. Refined cotton seed oil is also frequently
used in the manufacture of both products.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Oleomargarine Laws.</h3>

<p class='c023'>In 1886 Congress passed the “Oleomargarine Bill,” defining
butter to be an article made solely from milk and cream. It imposes
a tax of two cents per pound upon oleomargarine and
similar butter substitutes, compels their sale in certain sized
packages, plainly marked or branded with the name of their contents,
and requires manufacturers and dealers to take out special
licenses, all under heavy penalties. Some of the State laws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>restricting the sale of oleomargarine, are still more stringent, and
its consumption has diminished, although it is still used in some
sections and extensively exported.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c023'>No article of food appears to be more affected than cheese by
slight variations of the materials from which it is made, or by
such apparently trifling differences in the methods of manufacture.
Both full and skimmed milk are used; the former yielding,
of course, the best product. The latter cheese is little used
in this country. An English writer says that if milk is skimmed
for several days, “it yields a cheese so hard that pigs grunt at it,
dogs bark at it, but neither dare bite it.” People’s tastes vary
greatly in the flavor of cheese, and while some prefer the natural
tint, others buy that which is colored. Color adds neither richness
nor flavor, and is gradually falling into disuse.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Cheese as a Staple Food.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Some nations (as Great Britain, etc.,) consume cheese largely as
a staple food, while others use it more sparingly, and mainly as a
condiment or relish. Bread and cheese consort better with ale
than with whiskey and this country is not greatly given to cheese
as a staple food, although its consumption is increasing here,
owing to recent improvements in the modes of manufacture and in
its quality. Two-thirds of our total product now goes to Europe.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Good and Poor Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Cheese dries fast and shrinks in weight; hence the grocer who
sells it in small quantities is compelled to charge a fair margin
or advance upon its cost to save himself from loss. The
ordinary weight of American cheeses is about 60 lbs., but smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>ones are growing in favor, and many are now made weighing from
35 to 40 lbs. A grocer who has a good class of custom soon
realizes that our poor cheese takes the place of several good ones,
and it is his aim to secure a good and popular quality and
stick to it.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Facts About Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The best cheese is made from the rich June grasses, the poorest
in the heats of summer. June cheese is safest to keep, as the
curds are then scalded higher, to ensure that they will sustain the
coming warm weather. Cheese may be made for immediate use—and
such will grow sharp if long kept—or it may be so made
as to keep a year or more with constant improvement or ripening.
It requires about ten pounds of milk to make one pound of
cheese.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>“Filled” Cheese</span> is made by substituting lard in place of the
cream of the milk. Ten pounds of such cheese contains about 1
pound of lard. This product is largely made in some sections,
and is chiefly sold in the South or exported.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Classification of Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Cheese made in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin has
the first “Call” in the New York Mercantile Exchange.
“<span class='sc'>Fancy</span>” must be full cream, perfect in flavor, close made, well
cured, of uniform color and perfect surface. “<span class='sc'>Fine</span>” is the next
grade below—must be also full cream, clean flavor, etc. “<span class='sc'>Known
Marks</span>” or <span class='sc'>Factory Cheese</span> may not be full cream. “<span class='sc'>Western
Cheese</span>” “Shall include those of all States not mentioned above
and shall be classified as fancy, fine, and known marks, but they
may not be full cream.”</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Imported Cheese.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Swiss Cheese</span> comes from Switzerland, and more of this is imported
than of all others combined. Next stands <span class='sc'>Edam</span> from Holland.
The delicious <span class='sc'>Roquefort Cheese</span>, made in France, from
ewes milk and kept in mountain caves to ripen, stands third in
the list of imported cheeses, and <span class='sc'>Parmesan</span> stands fourth; it is
made from skimmed milk, the curd hardened by a gentle heat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>This and <span class='fss'>SBRINZ</span> cheese are used for soups—grated. <span class='sc'>Gorgonzola</span>
is a fine, rich, Italian cheese, each weighing about ten pounds.
Other good Italian cheeses are made from the milk of the buffalo
which feed on the Roman Campagna. <span class='sc'>Stilton</span> is the finest of
English cheeses. It is made from full milk with added cream. It
improves with age, and is best when at least two years old. The
<span class='sc'>Cheddar</span>, <span class='sc'>Cheshire</span> and <span class='sc'>Queen’s Arms</span> are other varieties of
good English cheese.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Eggs.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Eggs are cheap and substantial food. The white is mostly
albumen, while the yolk is two-thirds oil. Turkeys eggs are pronounced
the best in flavor. Guinea hens eggs are excellent, and
keep well on account of their thick shells. Goose eggs are larger,
whiter, and less esteemed. Duck eggs are bluish, and less desirable
than hens eggs. Eight hens eggs weigh a pound.</p>

<p class='c021'>A fresh egg feels heavy in the hand and is <a id='tn035'></a>semi-transparent before
the light. Its large end feels warm to the tongue. The
older it is, the less pleasant and nutritious it becomes. If it stands
upright in water it is bad; if obliquely it is not quite fresh. If
it lies at the bottom it is quite fresh. An egg begins to lose flavor
a few hours after it has been laid.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Lard.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Good, pure lard should be white, should melt without ebullition
or sputtering, be almost as clear and white as water, and not
deposit any sediment. It is composed of oleine 62 parts, stearine
65 parts. The fat of the hog taken from around the kidneys and
the layers over the ribs is called “Leaf lard” and is better,
firmer and will stand warm weather better, than lard made from
the entire fat of the animal.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lard Admixtures.</span>—There is no complaint that lard is adulterated
with substances injurious to health; but in February, 1888,
a leading lard manufacturer testified before the Senate Committee
on Agriculture, at Washington, that seven-eighths of
the lard now on the market is made from the entire fat of the
hog, refined and purified, and mixed with a proportion of refined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>cotton seed oil and about 15 per cent. of stearine, to give it
hardness. This, he claimed, is preferred by the public generally
to strictly pure lard. The testimony of Prof. Sharpless, of Boston,
given at the same time and place, substantially bore out this
statement as to the ingredients used, although in the many analyses
of American lard made by him, he found some brands which
were absolutely pure hog products. Lard is sometimes adulterated
with water, but this may be easily detected by melting it,
evaporating the water, and reweighing.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lard may be had in barrels, wooden and tin tubs and pails,
and in one pound tin cups. It is also retailed in bulk, like
butter.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Fresh Meats and Poultry.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Beef.</span>—Good beef should be juicy, somewhat firm and elastic,
velvety and smooth grained to the touch, and “marbled” with
little streaks, dots or points of fat. The suet fat should be
plentiful, white, firm, dry, and crumbly; if the fat is yellow,
oily, or fibrous, the beef is inferior.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mutton</span> is wholesome, nutritious, and easily digested. The
best is from a plump, small boned animal, with abundant white,
clear, solid fat. The lean should be firm, dark red, and juicy,
the leg bones clear, white, and short. <span class='sc'>Good Lamb</span> has hard,
white fat and reddish bones.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Pork</span> is best in fall and winter. The skin should be thin and
pearly, the lean a delicate red, juicy, firm, and finely grained,
and the fat white. If the fat is yellow and soft, the pork is inferior.
Pork is dangerous if not thoroughly cooked.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Veal</span> should be from a good sized, reasonably fat milk or stall
fed calf, five to ten weeks old. The fat should be firm and white,
but not too white; the meat finely grained, fairly firm, and
juicy.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Poultry.</span>—Many farmers have found that it pays better to
feed their grain to poultry than to sell it by the bushel, and
poultry is therefore much more abundant, cheaper, and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>widely consumed than ever before. The dry-picked or unscalded
has the preference in price. The best have short legs and small
bones, and are plump. If fresh, the eyes are bright and full, the
feet and legs moist and limber. If stale, poultry looks dark and
slimy. When chickens grow to be a year old they are called fowl;
the legs grow rougher, the skin fat and tougher, and the rear
end of the breast bone hard. A moderate sized <span class='fss'>TURKEY</span> is more
apt to be tender than a very large one.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Smoked and Dried Meats and Fish.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Hams, etc.</span>—The best are of medium size, weighing, say,
from 8 to 14 pounds, plump, round, and the bone small. The
shank should be short and tapering, skin thin and not shriveled
or wrinkled, and the fat white and firm. To ascertain if ham
has begun to spoil, thrust a skewer or knife in at the side of the
aitch bone and at the knuckle joint; if sound there, it is good
throughout. <span class='sc'>Bacon.</span>—This is the smoked flank. <span class='sc'>Breakfast
Bacon</span>, made from young pigs, is very delicate and palatable.
<span class='sc'>Beef Tongues</span> are a delicacy, whether fresh, smoked, or pickled,
hot or cold. The best are thick, firm, and with plenty of fat on
the under side of the base.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dried Cod.</span>—This is an important grocers’ staple. The largest
and best are caught on the “Banks” or in the deep waters
off the Eastern coast. Some are sold whole and others are deprived
of the back bone. Codfish is also prepared for market by being
boned, skinned, trimmed, and even shredded. Other and inferior
fish, such as Haddock, Hake, Pollock, etc., are often sold for
cod, when salted, and especially when prepared as above.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herring</span>, smoked whole, or scaled and boneless, are
widely consumed. The freshest, fattest, and largest are best.
Smoked <span class='fss'>SALMON</span>, <span class='fss'>HALIBUT</span>, and <span class='fss'>STURGEON</span>, are appetizing relishes
for the summer tea table. There are also <span class='fss'>EELS</span> pickled in jelly.
<span class='fss'>SARDELLES</span>—small fish packed in highly salted milk, smoked
<span class='fss'>SPRATS</span>, <span class='fss'>ANCHOVIES</span>, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Salt or Pickled Fish.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Mackerel have the front rank in this line, and there are few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>good tables on which they do not occasionally appear. They are
sold by the grocer in barrels and fractions of barrels, in kits of
20, 15, and 10 pounds, in tins, minus heads and tails, and by the
single fish. The best are the fattest, largest, and freshest of the
current season. They should be free from rust and soaked before
cooking until all the brine is drawn out. They can be
afterwards salted, if necessary. They are graded as “Extra” and
“Fancy” “Shores” and “Bays,” and vary in size and fatness,
as numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Salmon, etc.</span>—Both Halifax and Oregon salmon are pickled
or salted, and in demand in many sections of the country, and
pickled <span class='fss'>SALMON BELLIES</span> are very fine. <span class='sc'>Herring</span> and <span class='fss'>COD</span> are
also to be had in brine.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Meat Essences and Extracts.</h3>

<p class='c023'>There are several varieties of these articles in liquids, pastes,
and solids. Some, at least, of them, without being true nutrients
are excellent as condiments, stimulants, and tonics for digestion.
Meat juices contain a substance called kreatine, which is similar
in its <a id='tn038'></a>exhilarating properties to the peculiar principles of tea and
coffee. Fifty pounds of meat are said to be required to make one
pound of Liebig’s meat extract. These preparations are valuable
additions to other foods, but all that is needed for nourishment
should be added to them.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>CANNED GOODS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Until lately, man had done little more in preserving his food
in a fresh condition, than the squirrels which gather and store
their nuts and seeds in a warm, dry place. To be sure, he knew
how to dry and smoke, and the uses of salt and sugar. He had
even tried to preserve his meats and fruits in a fresh state; but
his rude methods hardly foreshadowed the splendid results which
have recently been achieved in the line of canned goods.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Excellence of American Canned Goods.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>M. Appert, of France, first patented (in 1810) a process for preserving
animal and vegetable substances in close vessels of
glass—after subjecting them to the action of heat—and an English
firm soon after introduced provisions preserved in tin.
But it was reserved for Americans to lead the world, not only in
the magnitude of their canning industries, but also in the art of
preserving meats, vegetables, and fruits, by processes so delicate
and effective, as to retain their original shape and texture, as well
as their freshness and flavor. And, moreover, while they have
practically prolonged the “Seasons” for perishable food products
throughout the entire year, and furnish them for the consumer
at very reasonable rates, the producer has often thanked them
for giving stability to prices in seasons of great “Gluts” and
abundance.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Varieties of Canned Goods.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Among canned goods, in glass or tin packages of various sizes,
qualities and prices, are the following:</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Canned Meats.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Corned beef</span>, boiled; <span class='fss'>ROAST BEEF</span>, <span class='fss'>BEEF A LA MODE</span>, <span class='fss'>BOILED
HAM</span>, <span class='fss'>BOILED TONGUE</span>, <span class='fss'>ROAST MUTTON</span>, <span class='fss'>ROAST VEAL</span>, <span class='fss'>ROAST
CHICKEN</span>, <span class='fss'>ROAST TURKEY</span>, <span class='fss'>BRAWN</span>, <span class='fss'>POTTED MEATS</span> of all kinds;
<span class='fss'>GAME PATES</span> of <span class='fss'>WILD DUCK</span>, <span class='fss'>GROUSE</span>, <span class='fss'>PARTRIDGE</span>, <span class='fss'>PLOVER</span>, <span class='fss'>WOODCOCK</span>;
<span class='fss'>BONED TURKEY AND CHICKEN</span>, with jelly; <span class='fss'>CURRIED

TONGUES</span>, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Canned Soups and Broths.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Beef</span>, <span class='fss'>CHICKEN</span>, <span class='fss'>GREEN TURTLE</span>, <span class='fss'>OXTAIL</span>, <span class='fss'>JULIENNE</span>, <span class='fss'>MOCK

<h3 class='c022'>Fish.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Clams</span>, <span class='fss'>CLAM CHOWDER</span>, <span class='fss'>ANCHOVIES</span>, <span class='fss'>CRABS FRESH</span>, <span class='fss'>CRABS

HERRING</span>, <span class='fss'>BLOATERS</span>, etc.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Canned Vegetables.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Asparagus</span>, Baked, Lima, and String <span class='fss'>BEANS</span>, <span class='fss'>GREEN CORN</span>,
<span class='fss'>MUSHROOMS</span>, <span class='fss'>OKRA</span>, <span class='fss'>ONIONS</span>, <span class='fss'>PEAS</span>, <span class='fss'>PUMPKIN</span>, <span class='fss'>SQUASH</span>, <span class='fss'>SUCCOTASH</span>,
<span class='fss'>SPINACH</span>, <span class='fss'>RHUBARB</span>, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Canned Fruits.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Apples</span>, <span class='fss'>APRICOTS</span>, <span class='fss'>BLACKBERRIES</span>, <span class='fss'>BLUEBERRIES</span>, <span class='fss'>CHERRIES</span>,
<span class='fss'>GRAPES</span>, <span class='fss'>GOOSEBERRIES</span>, <span class='fss'>PEACHES</span>, <span class='fss'>PEARS</span>, <span class='fss'>PLUMS</span>, <span class='fss'>PINEAPPLES</span>,
<span class='fss'>QUINCES</span>, <span class='fss'>RASPBERRIES</span>, <span class='fss'>STRAWBERRIES</span>, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Canned Sundries.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Besides the above, there are “Heaps” of canned delicacies, such,
for instance, as <span class='fss'>TRUFFLES</span>, <span class='fss'>TRUFFLE PATES</span>, <span class='fss'>TRUFFLE DU PERIGORD</span>,
in tins and glass, <span class='fss'>PLUM PUDDINGS</span>, <span class='fss'>PLUM PUDDING SAUCES</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'>Some of the French vegetables in glass and tin are beautifully
green in appearance, but it is evident that they are artificially
colored. A more wholesome device is to put the articles up in
the intensely green bottles sometimes seen.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Tin Cans.</span>—Tin is mainly used for canned goods, and is
the least objectionable of all the metals, and better than anything
probably, except glass. It does not oxidize easily, and if it does,
its soluble salts are less injurious than those of any other available
metal.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Jellies, Preserves, etc.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Jellies are made from nearly all the fruits by mixing their
juices with sugar, and often with gelatine or isinglass, (four parts
of which will convert 100 parts of water into a tremulous jelly)
and boiling them down. Jellies are wholesome, cooling, and
grateful, provided they are free from adulterations and noxious
colorings, and are much used upon the tea table and in the sick
room. Among the varieties of jelly in the market are <span class='fss'>APPLE</span>,
<span class='fss'>CRAB APPLE</span>, <span class='fss'>BLACKBERRY</span>, <span class='fss'>CURRANT</span>, <span class='fss'>GRAPE</span>, <span class='fss'>LEMON</span>, <span class='fss'>GUAVA</span>,
<span class='fss'>ORANGE</span>, <span class='fss'>QUINCE</span>, <span class='fss'>RASPBERRY</span>, <span class='fss'>STRAWBERRY</span>, etc. They come in
tumblers and jars, and in bulk. There are also <span class='fss'>CALVES’ FOOT</span>,
<span class='fss'>WINE</span> and <span class='fss'>SPIRIT</span> jellies.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Preserves.</span>—All the above fruits are preserved in sugar, and
put up in quart and pint jars. <span class='sc'>Cherries</span>, <span class='fss'>PEACHES</span>, <span class='fss'>PEARS</span>, etc.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>are also preserved in <span class='fss'>BRANDY</span>, and sold in glass jars. There is
also a great variety of <span class='fss'>JAMS</span> and <span class='fss'>MARMALADES</span>, both foreign and
domestic; <span class='fss'>GINGER ROOT</span>, boiled in syrup, etc. <span class='sc'>Fruit butter</span> is
made from various fruits, as, Apple, Cranberry, Peach, Pear,
or Raspberry, etc., by stewing them in sugar or molasses. It is
usually sold from pails by the pound, and is much used in some
sections.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Flavoring Extracts and Essences.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The delicate flavors of fruit and the fragrant principles of spice
and other substances, as vanilla, etc., are extracted by pressure or
distillation, and dissolved in spirits of wine for culinary purposes.
It is found also, that certain ethers and oils may be so combined
(as, for instance, potato oil) as to yield the taste and smell of
many fruits, such as pears, apples, grapes, pineapples, etc.
Flavoring extracts and essences are variously put up in vials and
bottles; among them are <span class='fss'>LEMON</span>, <span class='fss'>VANILLA</span>, <span class='fss'>ROSE</span>, <span class='fss'>ALMOND</span>, <span class='fss'>PEACH</span>,
<span class='fss'>CELERY</span>, <span class='fss'>GINGER</span>, <span class='fss'>CLOVES</span>, <span class='fss'>NUTMEG</span>, <span class='fss'>STRAWBERRY</span>, <span class='fss'>RASPBERRY</span>,
<span class='fss'>PINEAPPLE</span>, <span class='fss'>NECTARINE</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Isinglass and gelatine</span> are used to make jellies, and thicken
soups and gravies. Isinglass is made from the intestines of fish.
Its advantages over gelatine are lighter color, less flavor, and
greater thickening power. In cold water it softens, swells, becomes
white and opaque. In hot water it smells a little fishy.
Gelatine is made from the bones of animals; it also swells in cold
water, but becomes glassy and transparent, while in hot water it
has somewhat the smell of glue. It is often sold for isinglass.
The test of both is in the fineness and clearness of their jelly.
<span class='sc'>Calves’ foot jelly</span> is delicate, but less firm. Gelatine is sold
in sheets and shreds.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Herbs</span> for seasoning, as, <span class='fss'>SAGE</span>, <span class='fss'>SUMMER SAVORY</span>, <span class='fss'>SWEET MARJORAM</span>,
<span class='fss'>THYME</span>, etc., are sold in the leaf, and also powdered, in
tins and paper packets.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Spices and Condiments.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Spices are generally understood to be more aromatic and fragrant
and less pungent than what are called condiments. Spices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>are usually added to sweetened food, while condiments, as pepper
and mustard, are better suited to meats and food containing
salt.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is impossible to supply genuine articles if the public are not
willing to pay for them, and it may be accepted as a general rule,
that the lower the price of ground spices and condiments, the more
they are adulterated. The materials chiefly used for this purpose
are starch, cracker dust and similar harmless substances, and the
mixture usually contains as much of the pure material as can
reasonably be afforded at the price it sells for. The purchaser
may elect whether he will have such articles, or those which are
genuine at a higher cost. The grocer does not create wants and
demands; he merely supplies them.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Pepper.</span>—There are two kinds, black and white. Both are
from the seeds of the <i>piper nigrum</i>, a plant which grows in the
East and West Indies. <span class='sc'>Black pepper</span> is the seed picked before
it is fully ripe, dried and ground. <span class='sc'>White pepper</span> is made from
the ripened seed deprived of its black outer shell or pericarp.
Pepper is an agreeable addition to many kinds of food, and is
said to promote the secretion of the gastric juice; it is more used
than any other spice.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cayenne pepper</span> is the powdered pod of one or more species
of capsicum. The sharp taste is due to a camphor like substance
found more in the pods than in the seeds.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mustard.</span>—This is the flour of the black or white mustard
seed. The black seed contains most volatile oil, is more pungent,
and differs from the white in chemical composition. The
two are blended in various proportions. Wheat flour is often
added, with a little turmeric to bring up the color. Mustard
seed contains over 30 per cent. of a fixed oil, and a portion of
this is often extracted. This practice is considered beneficial
rather than fraudulent.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Ginger.</span>—This is the root-stalk of a plant which grows in
Jamaica and other warm countries. The best comes with the
skin scraped off. This is ground. The odor of ginger is due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>an essential oil; its pungency to a peculiar resin. It is sometimes
adulterated with starch, sago, rice, and wheat flour, mustard
hulls, cayenne pepper, etc. But, as with all the other spices,
there are pure brands.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cloves</span> are the dried flower buds of the clove tree. They
come from the East Indies, Africa, and South America, ranking
in value in the order named. The best contain as much as 16 per
cent. of a volatile oil to which their flavor is due. Ground cloves
have sometimes a portion of this oil pressed out, with <a id='tn043'></a>pimento
or allspice added, which latter is much less costly. Cloves are
best when large, plump, bright in tint, and full of oil, which
exudes on pressure with the finger nail.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Allspice or pimento</span> is the little, round berry of an evergreen
tree, common in the West Indies. It contains about 4 per cent.
of an aromatic oil. Owing to its cheapness, it is less adulterated
than other spices.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cinnamon</span> is the true bark of a small evergreen tree of Ceylon.
The best is very thin, the outer and inner coats of the bark having
been removed.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cassia</span> is the bark of another species of cinnamon tree; it is
thicker, corky, and not so red. It is cheap and not much adulterated.
It is often sold for cinnamon, but is less aromatic and
valuable. <span class='sc'>Cassia buds</span> are the unripe buds of the same tree.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Nutmegs and Mace.</span>—Nutmegs are the seeds of the <i>Myristica
Fragrans</i>, a tree which grows in the East Indies. Good nutmegs
feel heavy in the hand, and are not worm eaten. They
contain about 8 per cent. of volatile oil, and 25 per cent. of fixed
oil, which exudes under indentation or pressure with the finger
nail. Most people buy whole nutmegs and the ground article
has only a limited sale. <span class='sc'>Mace</span> is the arillus or coating of the nutmeg,
and is also sold whole or unground<a id='tn043-period'></a>.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Curry Powder.</span>—This compound of spices, etc., is much used
in India and other hot countries, as an appetizer and stimulant
to digestion. There are several excellent brands of curry powder
in market, both English and American, made approximately
after some one of the following five receipts:</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Salt.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Common Salt</span> varies in purity and sometimes contains salts of
lime, magnesia, and potash. But as those are more soluble in
water than common salt, it is easy to remove them in the process
of manufacture. Our culinary salt comes from several sources;
rock salt deposits or mines, sea water, and salt springs.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are numerous brands of salt which are freed from all impurity,
ground to various degrees of fineness, and put up in barrels,
sacks, bags and packets of all sizes; also in stone jars.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Celery salt</span> is good common salt mingled with the finely
ground seeds of celery.</p>

<p class='c021'>Besides the finer qualities for table use, there are varieties specially
adapted for salting and pickling meats, fish, etc.; lump rock
salt for cattle, hay salt, etc. The bitter salts of lime, magnesia,
etc., attract moisture more than common salt, hence dryness is a
sign of purity.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Vinegar.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The sour principle is acetic acid, of which good vinegar contains
about four per cent. Vinegar may be obtained by fermentation
from the juice of any starchy or sweet fruit or vegetable,
from beer, or even from sweetened water, to which “mother” or
other vinegar is added. Cider vinegar is most used, as it retains
the fruity flavor of the apple, but good vinegar is also made from
wine, malt, oranges, raspberries, etc. There are many varieties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in market, both domestic and foreign. Stringent laws regulate
the purity and strength of vinegar for domestic uses, in New York
and some other states.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Pickles.</h3>

<p class='c023'>These are fruits and vegetables preserved in vinegar, after first
steeping them in brine. Certain articles require to be pickled in
scalding hot vinegar, others with cold; salt, pepper and spices
are added to suit the taste. Pickles were formerly extensively
colored green with copper, but the ghastly practice has gone out
of date. Intelligent people will prefer those which have the
more natural and wholesome yellowish, olive green tint. There
are all sorts of pickles in market, put up in glass or wood packages
of various sizes, as follows:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cucumbers</span> and <span class='fss'>GHERKINS</span>, <span class='fss'>CHOW CHOW</span>, <span class='fss'>CAULIFLOWER</span>, <span class='fss'>ONIONS</span>,
<span class='fss'>MANGOES</span>, <span class='fss'>PICALILLI</span>, <span class='fss'>WALNUTS</span>, <span class='fss'>PEPPERS</span>, <span class='fss'>HORSERADISH</span>, <span class='fss'>MIXED
PICKLES</span>, and <span class='fss'>SWEET PICKLES</span>. Among the best of imported pickles
are the reliable Cross and Blackwell goods; some domestic
brands are perhaps equally good. <span class='sc'>Olives</span> are in brine, usually
in wide-mouthed glass jars. They come from Italy, Spain, and
France. The “Queen,” “Crescent,” etc., are favorite brands.
There are also French <span class='fss'>CAPERS</span>, so important as an accompaniment
for boiled mutton, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Salad oil.</span>—The best is the oil of the <span class='fss'>OLIVE</span>, which, when
pure, is of pale, greenish yellow tint, with an agreeable odor and
taste. Refined <span class='sc'>Cottonseed oil</span> has naturally a more reddish
tint. It is extensively sold as olive oil or mixed with it, although
many grocers keep the genuine olive oil. <span class='sc'>Salad dressings</span> are
also in market, some of which are very fine and delicate.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Sauces.</h3>

<p class='c023'>These articles give zest to food and stimulate digestion. Their
composition is very varied and embraces many fruits and vegetables,
as the tomato, walnut, garlic, shallot; many herbs, as tarragon,
chervill, mint, thyme, marjoram; many condiments, as cayenne,
black pepper, mustard, and all the spices; many fish, as lobsters,
oysters, clams, shrimp, anchovies; the juices of meat, besides salt,
sugar, molasses, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><span class='sc'>Pepper sauce</span> is made from the little Jamaica peppers, the
Mexican, Chili pepper, or some other variety of red or green pepper.
There are numerous brands, and nearly all are good. The
<span class='fss'>TABASCO PEPPER SAUCE</span> is excellent. <span class='sc'>Tomato catsup or ketchup</span>
is a very wholesome and agreeable addition to the diet.
Among the best and most popular varieties is the <span class='fss'>“SHREWSBURY”
TOMATO KETCHUP</span>. Mushroom and Walnut Catsups are less used,
but still have many friends.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the dainty and well known <span class='fss'>SAUCES</span>, are the <span class='fss'>WORCESTERSHIRE</span>,
<span class='fss'>LEICESTERSHIRE</span>, <span class='fss'>GLOUCESTERSHIRE</span>, <span class='fss'>SULTANA</span>, <span class='fss'>PICCADILLY</span>,
<span class='fss'>CHUTNEE</span>, <span class='fss'>SOHO</span>, <span class='fss'>HARVEY</span>, <span class='fss'>NORTH OF ENGLAND</span>, etc. There
are also various American sauces, some of which are imitations of
the above or very similar in composition and flavor. Some of the
English sauces are put up in elegant and artistic vases.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>DOMESTIC FRUITS AND BERRIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The increasing excellence, abundance and cheapness of fruits
and berries is full of promise for the health and vigor of the
American people. They are wholesome, cooling and nutritious.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Apples.</span>—This noble fruit is in market the year round; new
Southern apples are first marketed in April. <span class='sc'>Apricots</span> are a fine
small fruit which ripens in July. <span class='sc'>Cherries</span> reach us from the
South in May. <span class='sc'>Nectarines</span> come in August. <span class='sc'>Peaches</span> are at
the height of their season in August and September. Early in
the latter month they should be secured for preserving. <span class='sc'>Pears.</span>—The
choicest are the Dutchess, Bartlett and Virgalieu. <span class='sc'>California
pears</span> are excellent and widely sold through the country.
<span class='sc'>Plums</span> ripen in August, and are in season until October. <span class='sc'>Quince</span>
is a highly flavored fruit, used only for preserves. <span class='sc'>Grapes.</span>—Besides
our own abundant and delicious Muscat, Concord, Isabella,
Catawba, and other varieties, three-quarters of a million barrels
of the hardy and cooling white Almeria grapes are annually imported
at New York. They were formerly a costly luxury, but
are now abundant and cheap, and will keep through the winter.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><span class='sc'>Strawberries.</span>—The season opens with shipments from Florida
early in March, and closes six months later with the product
of the far North. <span class='sc'>Raspberries</span> come in June and continue
until August. <span class='sc'>Blackberries</span> ripen early in July, and are very
healthful. <span class='sc'>Currants</span> ripen in July and continue until September;
they are white, red and black, and are wholesome and cooling.
<span class='sc'>Gooseberries</span> may be had red, yellow, green and white.
They are much used unripe, for cooking purposes. <span class='sc'>Cranberries</span>
begin to reach market from Cape Cod, New Jersey, etc., about
September first. The largest and darkest are the best. They are
healthful and an almost indispensable adjunct to roast turkey, etc.;
are also used for sauces, tarts, and pies.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Tropical Fruits.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The increased knowledge in regard to the excellence and
healthfulness of these fruits has, within a few years, greatly enlarged
the demand for them, and they are now sold at moderate
prices in almost every city and town in the land.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Oranges.</span>—Those from Florida and California are richer and
of finer flavor, while the Mediterranean variety are thin skinned,
juicy, hardy, and will keep longer. That region sends us annually
a million boxes of oranges, and the annual product of Florida
and California is two million boxes. Havana oranges are
not as good as they used to be, but twenty thousand barrels come
to New York yearly from Cuba.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Lemons.</span>—A million and a half boxes of lemons are consumed
yearly in this country, most of which come from Sicily, but
lemon culture is increasing in Florida. Lemons vary much more
in price than oranges, as a heated term or unusual sickness increases
the consumption.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Bananas and other fruits.</span>—There are two varieties, the
red from Cuba, and the yellow from Jamaica and the Spanish
Main. The latter are the better. Bananas are in market all the
year, but the season is from March to August. <span class='sc'>Pineapples</span> are
exquisitely flavored fruit, much used sliced for the tea table.
The season is from May to August. <span class='sc'>Cocoanuts</span> are used grated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>for making pies and puddings; they are delicious, but rather indigestible.
<span class='sc'>Dessicated cocoanut</span> is the meat of cocoanuts
ground and dried, and mixed with powdered sugar; sometimes,
also, rice, flour, or corn starch is added. It comes in packets,
cans, etc.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>FRESH VEGETABLES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>In the Spring and Summer months the appetite craves fresh
vegetables; and their free use, especially in those seasons, will be
found excellent for the general health of the family. Spinach,
for instance, is said to be beneficial in kidney complaints; Dandelion
greens are good for biliousness; Tomatoes act upon the
liver; Celery upon the nerves; Onion soup restores a debilitated
stomach, etc., etc. In fact, it would be easy thus to go through
the whole vegetable list and find each one possessing some special
mission of healthfulness.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Where Early Vegetables Come From.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The Bermudas send annually about $400,000 worth of potatoes,
onions, beets and tomatoes to New York, during the months of
March, April and May. Florida garden produce finds its way
North very early in the Spring, and later, in regular order, Georgia,
South and North Carolina, and Virginia, wheel into line with
their numerous productions, until, finally, our home gardeners
have their season. During all this time our vegetables on sale
are improving in freshness as they are drawn from sources nearer
home, and prices are falling.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>The Varieties.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Potatoes.</span>—The heavier ones are more mealy and nutritious than
those which are waxy and soft. There are many favorite varieties.
Some are early but less mealy, others prolific but lacking in
flavor, etc.—hence prices vary. <span class='sc'>Sweet Potatoes.</span>—There are two
varieties—the red and yellow—with but little difference in price.
<span class='sc'>Cabbage.</span>—A standard vegetable the year round; the heaviest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>are the best. <span class='sc'>Cauliflower</span>, best from April to December; the
large, creamy white, solid heads are preferred; dark or soft spots
indicate staleness. <span class='sc'>Onions</span> are very nutritious; their powerful odor
is due to a strong smelling, volatile, sulphurized oil. There are the
white or silver skinned, yellow and red. Spanish Onions are
milder, and much eaten raw. <span class='sc'>Garlic</span>, a pungent species of the
onion tribe, and very healthful; used for flavoring. <span class='sc'>Leeks</span> and
<span class='sc'>Chives</span> are allies of the onion. Leeks have large leaves, a thick
stalk and small root; Chives, used as salads, have small, spine-like
leaves. <span class='sc'>Carrots</span>, <span class='sc'>Turnips</span>, <span class='sc'>Beets</span> and <span class='sc'>Parsnips</span> are standard
vegetables to be had throughout the year; frost improves
the latter.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Asparagus.</span>—A choice and health giving vegetable. Season begins
in March, and it grows fibrous in July. <span class='sc'>Celery</span> is improved
by frost, and is in its prime and cheapest during the winter
months, after which it becomes tougher and stringy. <span class='sc'>Cucumbers.</span>—A
pleasant, cooling vegetable, but difficult of digestion, and containing
little nourishment. <span class='sc'>Tomatoes</span> are excellent food for people
with weak stomachs or liver difficulties; is a vegetable that
could ill be spared. Millions of bushels are canned every year,
and if properly put up are nearly as good as the fresh article.
<span class='sc'>Peas.</span>—The smaller varieties are best, should be purchased in the
pods, which should be cool, crisp and green. A black spot on
the pea indicates that it is too old to be at its best. <span class='sc'>Beans</span>, shelled
and string.—The former embrace the Lima sorts. The Neapolitan
or snap is considered best of the String beans. <span class='sc'>Green Corn</span>
comes from the South in May, and the home supply lasts till October.
Ears should be well filled and milky, and not too old.
Green sweet corn is the best.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Rhubarb.</span>—Much used for sauce and pies. The leaves are said
to contain oxalic acid, and must not be eaten. <span class='sc'>Radish</span>, said to
be difficult of digestion itself, but helps to digest other food.
There are two varieties, the small bulbous, or round, and the
long. <span class='sc'>Artichoke</span>, a tuber like the <a id='tn049'></a>potato; is pickled, used as
a salad and as a vegetable. <span class='sc'>Squash.</span>—The summer squash is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>market from April to September. Winter squash is more substantial
but less delicate. <span class='sc'>Oyster Plant</span> has a grassy top, and a
long, tapering, white root like a carrot; its flavor suggests that of
oysters. <span class='sc'>Egg Plant</span>, called <span class='sc'>Guinea Squash</span> at the South, should
be firm, hard, and rather under ripe, it also tastes somewhat like
an oyster; the large, purple, oval shaped, is the better variety.
<span class='sc'>Okra</span> or <span class='sc'>Gumbo</span>.—The green seed pods are much esteemed for
soups and stews, especially in the South, and are growing in favor
at the North. The long green variety is considered best. <span class='sc'>Lettuce</span>,
<span class='sc'>Spinach</span>, <span class='sc'>Brussels Sprouts</span>, <span class='sc'>Kale</span>, <span class='sc'>Beet-tops</span>, <span class='sc'>Dandelion
Leaves</span>, <span class='fss'>ETC.</span>, are used as salads and for greens.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Melons.</span>—<span class='sc'>Musk-melon</span>, the stronger the musk odor, the finer
it is; but if it appears quite ripe all over, it is over ripe and decomposing.
If it has no odor, it is only fit for cattle. <span class='sc'>Water-melon</span>,
if pressed near its center, should yield a little, and the
indentation disappear when the finger is removed. If no indent
can be made, the melon is too green, if the depression remains,
the melon is over ripe.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Beans</span>, <span class='sc'>Peas</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lentils</span>.—These leguminous seeds are very
nutritious and palatable, and rank high among strength-giving
foods. They contain vegetable casein in place of gluten, and
hence are not suitable for making bread; all these articles are
more digestible if eaten with fat, and the American staple dish of
Pork and Beans is really the marriage of two articles which agree
very well with each other. Dried <span class='sc'>Peas</span>, split, or ground into
meal, are much used for soups. <span class='sc'>Lentils</span>, which are round
seeds like flattened peas, are excellent used as a vegetable, but
are comparatively little known. The most popular varieties of
the white beans are the Marrow, Kidney and Pea beans. There
are also <i>Frijoles</i> or black beans, Lima beans, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>DRIED FRUITS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The chief consideration with articles in this line is, that they
should be as fresh as possible, and free from vermin and traces of
vermin. Worms in dried fruits are never in sight, even though
they may swarm below the surface. <span class='sc'>Dried Apples</span> should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>light colored, plump and acid. Evaporated fruit (by the Alden
process, etc.) is preferred to sun-dried. It is often bleached in
the fumes of sulphurous acid, which has a tendency to keep the
fruit free from worms, and does not injure the flavor. <span class='sc'>Dried
Peaches</span> should be pealed, clear and dark. <span class='sc'>Dried Plums</span> should
be pitted, clear and bright. <span class='sc'>Dried Berries</span>—the chief danger
is from worms.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Raisins.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Raisins are dried grapes. The finest are the Dehesa “Layers;”
next are the <span class='sc'>Cluster</span>, or <span class='sc'>Bunch</span> raisins, and the “<span class='sc'>Loose</span>,” which
are without stems. They are better in proportion to the number
of crowns in the brand, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Crowns. The small seedless
raisins are called “<span class='sc'>Sultana</span>,” and come from Smyrna. <span class='sc'>Valencias</span>
are the common cooking raisins. <span class='sc'>California Raisins</span>
(Muscatel) are excellent, very fast growing in popular favor,
and are the coming summer raisin. The best raisins are of the
“Last crop.” Age tends to <a id='tn051'></a>crystallize the grape sugar in raisins,
and they are also liable to the attacks of vermin.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dried Currants</span> are the small dried grapes of the Ionian Islands.
The “<i>Vostizza</i>” come in cases, and are considered better
in proportion as they are larger in size. There are a number of
varieties of currants. They should be bright and clean.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Figs</span> are said to be easier of digestion than any other dried
sweet fruit, and are slightly laxative. “<i>Eleme</i>,” signifies superior,
or hand picked. Generally the last crop “Layers” (as distinguished
from those in kegs) are the best; they should be fresh,
moist, thin skinned, semi-transparent, and free from vermin.
There are many varieties, and they are put up in all sorts of packages.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Prunes</span> are dried plums, or “French plums,” as they are sometimes
called. They are extensively raised in the valley of the
Loire, in France; also in Germany, and about Bosnia, in Turkey.
California prunes are also excellent, and very popular wherever
they are known. The largest and freshest prunes are the best.
They come in bottles, tins, bags, boxes and casks.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Dates.</span>—This “Bread of the Desert” is the sun-dried fruit of
the date palm, and is both nourishing and palatable. Dates were
formerly packed in frails, but now come usually in boxes. Among
the best varieties of Persian and Egyptian dates are the “Hallowee”
and the “<i>Sair</i>;” some are large, yellow, moist, and little
wrinkled, others are smaller, dark in color, with small pits; some
are very sweet and insipid, and others almost aromatic in flavor.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Tamarinds</span> are the pods of a tree, growing in the East and
West Indies, gathered when ripe, and preserved in sugar or molasses.
They are acid, pleasant, healthful, and cooling. They
come in bottles, stone jars and kegs.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>NUTS.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Almonds</span> are of two kinds, the sweet and bitter; the latter are only
used for making extracts. Among the edible varieties are the Tarragona,
Valencia, “Jordan,” a corruption of <i>Jardin</i> (garden),
etc. There are hard, soft, and “paper shell” almonds, and almond
meats freed from their shells. <span class='sc'>Filberts</span> are cultivated hazel nuts
and come mainly from Sicily. <span class='sc'>Pecans</span> come from Texas. <span class='sc'>Walnuts</span>
from Italy, France, and Chili. <span class='sc'>Brazil Nuts</span> grow along the
Amazon in clusters on high trees. They are oily and rich. <span class='sc'>Peanuts</span>
come from Virginia, and <span class='sc'>Chestnuts</span> from Italy and our own
Northern States.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>TOBACCO.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The active principle of tobacco is the alkaloid nicotine, but
it cannot be said that the effects of tobacco are solely due to this
substance, for some varieties, as the Syrian, etc., contains little or
no nicotine, yet are considered strong. The quantity of nicotine
varies much in tobacco, or from one-half of one per cent. to eight
per cent. As a rule, the finer the quality and flavor, the less nicotine
the tobacco contains.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are many varieties of tobacco, as those of Virginia, Kentucky,
Maryland, etc., which are used mainly for chewing, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the Cuban, Turkish, Connecticut, Sumatra, etc., are considered
better for cigars. All these tobaccos may vary again in species,
as, for instance, there are the Orinoco, Cienfuegos, White Stem,
One Sucker, Isabella, White Barley, Fiji Orinoco, Cubani, and
many others. Havana or Cuban tobacco has long held the palm
over all the world for making the most exquisitely flavored cigars.
The aromatic principles on which its value depends can only be
developed under a warm, moist climate.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Chewing Tobacco</h3>

<p class='c023'>Is used both in the “<span class='fss'>PLUG</span>” form and as “<span class='fss'>FINE CUT</span>,” and in some
localities preference is given to the one, while little of the other
is sold. The New England and some of the Western States take their
chewing tobacco largely in plugs, while the Middle States take
more kindly to the fine cut. Detroit has a national reputation for
the manufacture of fine cut tobaccos, which are extensively sold
in tin foil and paper packages, and in bulk, in pails, etc. There
are many hundreds of brands of chewing tobacco, both plug and
fine cut. Some are the natural leaf, while others are sweetened;
so that the most diversified tastes may be satisfied.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Smoking Tobacco.</h3>

<p class='c023'>North Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky are foremost among the
States in the manufacture of the smoking tobaccos, which are
almost infinite in variety and sold in all sorts of packages. Among
them are the “Long” and “Short cut,” “Navy Clippings,” “Granulated,”
“Nigger Head,” “Sweet Spun Roll,” “Golden Cavendish,”
“Durham,” “Fruits and Flowers,” “Seal of North Carolina,”
“Seal of Virginia,” and many others, besides imported
varieties, as Persian, Latakia, Havana, etc. In addition to smoking
tobaccos, many grocers keep a full assortment of <span class='fss'>PIPES</span>, from
the common clay up, through all kinds of briar and applewood
pipes to the genuine meerschaum goods of every style and quality.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Cigars.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The value of a cigar depends not only on the quality of the
leaf, but largely also on the mode of manufacture. If rolled too
hard or too loosely, it will burn badly.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Why a Cigar Should Burn Well.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The best burning leaves must be used for wraps; if not, the
air has no access to the inside burning parts, and the empyreumatical
substances are volatilized without being decomposed. Such
cigars make much smoke and smell disagreeably. If the cigar
burns well, more of the nicotine is consumed and decomposed.
Cigars, therefore, which contain little nicotine and burn poorly,
are more narcotic in their effects than well burning cigars which
contain a greater quantity of nicotine. Hence, the leaves of the
Connecticut or “Seed leaf” tobacco, which burn freely and well,
are much used for wrappers for cigars filled with Havana tobacco.
Within recent years, however, the handsome leaved Sumatra
tobacco is quite largely used for wrappers upon medium priced
cigars, as it burns better than Cuban tobacco.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Quality of Cigars.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The real excellence of a very high-priced cigar is not in proportion
to its cost, which depends largely on its size and the fancy
of the buyer. For instance, a 50-cent cigar will burn no better
nor be much, if any more fragrant than a 25-cent cigar. It may
be larger, and the large Havana leaves, free from veins and suitable
for use as wrappers for fine, large cigars are so scarce and
high, as to enhance their cost out of all proportion to that of an
equally well flavored, though smaller cigar. In fact, 10 or 15
cents should procure as good a medium sized cigar as average
people care to smoke. The dude’s dollar cigar is not much, if any
better, except as fancy makes it so.</p>

<p class='c021'>Many of the 5-cent cigars sold so extensively, contain a large
proportion of Havana tobacco, and make a fairly fragrant and
pleasant smoke. It is said that there are upwards of 100,000 open
and proprietary brands of cigars on the market.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Cigarettes.</span>—The sale of these little paper tubes filled with
tobacco, has grown enormously within a few years and is still increasing.
It is whispered that the ladies even, sometimes seek to find
in them a whiff of the solace and comfort their brothers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>husbands find in the pipe or cigar. There are many favorite
brands on the market.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Snuff.</span>—This article which is made from the stems and refuse
of the tobacco, or largely so, is comparatively little used in this
country; but in some sections, and especially in the South it is
sold to a considerable extent. It comes in bulk and in jars, bottles,
bladders, and packets. Among the varieties are “Carolina
Sweet” and plain Scotch Snuff, Maccaboy and coarse French
Rappee, scented or plain.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c011'>SOAP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Soap is made by boiling down oils or fats in a water solution of
caustic soda or potash. Through the acid properties of the fats,
the oleine, stearine, margarine, etc., which they contain, combine
with the alkali to produce the saponified compound.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hard soap is made with soda; soft soap with potash. The
more oleine in the fat, the softer the soap; the more stearine the
harder. Rosin is also largely used, sometimes to the extent of
one-third the weight of the soap. It increases its hardness,
makes it dissolve easier in water and forms a more copious lather.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>The Most Economical Soap.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Soap may be two-thirds water and still remain solid. Even
dry, hard soap contains 20 or 25 per cent. of moisture. An excess
of water causes soap to waste or dissolve too freely in use; hence,
as soap is perpetually losing water by evaporation, the most economical
to buy is that with some age and moderately dry, yet not
so much dried that it will not dissolve readily and make a good
lather or suds.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Effects of Strong Soap on Fabrics.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Soap must not be strong enough to injure fabrics or discharge
colors, yet sufficiently powerful to render grease and dirt soluble,
so that it may be washed away in water. Rosin soap hardens the
fibers of wool, and alkalies, if used to excess, shrink woolen fabrics.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Hard water, or that containing lime or magnesia, more or less
decomposes soap, and it floats on the surface as a greasy scum.
But if an oily film rises to the top of soft water, it shows that
the fat in the soap is not all saponified. Soft water is better than
hard for fabrics.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>What Soaps Are Made Of.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Common Yellow Bar Soap</span> contains soda with fat and rosin.
<span class='sc'>White Soap</span> consists of tallow and soda. <span class='sc'>Castile Soap</span> is made
of olive oil and soda. <span class='sc'>Common Fancy Soaps</span> are mainly ordinary
soap colored and scented. Real <span class='sc'>Brown Windsor Soap</span> is made
of goat tallow, olive oil and soda. <span class='sc'>Transparent Soaps</span> are those
which have been dissolved in alcohol. <span class='sc'>Fine Toilet Soaps</span> are
made with as little alkali as possible, of almond, palm or olive
oil, suet, lard, etc., colored and perfumed.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Shaving Soaps</span> and <span class='sc'>Creams</span> are made either with soda or potash,
of fine tallow or cocoanut oil, which has the property of
making a strong lather. <span class='sc'>Mottled Soaps</span> owe their variegations
of color to the use of iron oxides. It is said that these cannot be
effectively applied if the soap contains an excess of water, and
that more skill is required to make good blue mottled soap than
any other. The more any soap is worked over, or remelted,
cooled, etc., the better it becomes.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>A Wide Range of Choice.</h3>

<p class='c023'>There is a great variety of soaps upon the market, and language
has been ransacked to find appropriate names for them. Among
them are “<span class='sc'>Family</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Laundry</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Ivory</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Best Soap</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Electric</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Ozone</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Borax</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Sand Soap</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Silver Soap</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Sapolio</span>,” etc., and many scouring and detergent articles, as
“<span class='sc'>Pearline</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Soapine</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Scourene</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Washing Compound</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Washing Crystal</span>,” etc.</p>

<p class='c021'>In Toilet Soaps there is an equally wide range of choice, embracing
every color and variegation of color, and every perfume
that is agreeable to the smell. Soaps are also charged with disinfecting
substances, as carbolic acid, etc., and variously medicated
with sulphur, camphor, glycerine, and other materials for
softening and healing the skin.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
<h3 class='c022'>STARCH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Laundry starch is mostly made from corn. The grain is crushed
and fermented to a degree, when the starch is washed out and allowed
to settle in large vats. The best qualities are washed and
settled again and again; the number of washings grading the
strength, purity and cost. Potato starch is more costly than corn
starch, and, as it gives a softer finish to fabrics, is chiefly used by
manufacturers. Corn starch for culinary purposes is thoroughly
washed, purified and deodorized. Laundry starch should never
be eaten.</p>

<p class='c021'>The best laundry starch is in large, hard, flinty crystals; such
indicate a stronger starch, containing less moisture than that with
small or soft crystals. Laundry starch comes in bulk or boxes,
and in paper packages. There are many fancy proprietary brands
of starch, as “<span class='sc'>Ivory</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Ivorine</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Gloss</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Satin Gloss</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Silver Gloss</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Gloss Polish</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Elastic</span>,” etc. Some of them
are powdered, and contain borax, wax, or gum, etc., and are
scented with winter-green, etc. Such come higher than the better
grades of laundry starch in crystals, but it is a question if they
are proportionately superior for family use. <span class='sc'>Starch polishes</span>
are preparations of spermaceti, wax, or paraffine.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Blueing (Laundry).</h3>

<p class='c023'>This article may be had in balls, powders, or in a liquid form.
There are a goodly number of proprietary brands, some of which
give a tint which appears somewhat greenish when placed by the
side of a pure and delicate blue. The coloring principle is usually
indigo, Prussian blue, or the favorite ultramarine. The most satisfactory
laundry blueing is that which is really and intensely blue
in tint, and which is most completely soluble in water, so that it
will be well distributed and not make the clothes look streaked.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Candles.</h3>

<p class='c023'>In some sections, candles form an important article of trade.
They are now made in a great variety of exquisite tints by the use
of analine colors of various sizes and weights, and with patent
self-fitting ends. The more costly kinds are made of spermaceti,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>wax, stearine, paraffine, etc., down to the pressed, adamantine,
and common tallow candles. Some carry embossed and handsome
decalcomania decorations and are either white, blue, green, pink,
yellow, red, etc., or assorted. There are “<span class='sc'>Boudoir</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Piano</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Cable</span>,” and “<span class='sc'>Flag</span>” candles, wax “<span class='sc'>Night
Lights</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Christmas Tree Candles</span>,” and wax “<span class='sc'>Gas
Lighters</span>,” warranted not to drip.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Brushes.</span>—No domestic article is in more common use than the
brush in its various forms. The best bristles come from the wild
hog of Russia and Poland. The whitest and finest are used for
paint, tooth, hat, hair, and clothes brushes. Some brushes are
made with one tuft only, like the paint brush, others with many.
The best are “Wire drawn;” that is, the tufts are bent double to
form loops through which wires are passed, to draw and hold them
firmly into the holes of the base. Others have the tufts wedged
or glued in. Brushes are made with long and short handles,
and of every conceivable form and quality, from “Sink scrubs”
upward.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Brooms.</span>—The finer the corn the better the broom. A natural
green color indicates toughness and flexibility, and such corn is
better than that which is of a sickly yellow or lemon color. But
the latter is often given the desired green tint by artificial colorings.
Plain or unpainted handles are best, good brooms weigh
25 to 30 pounds to the dozen, but extra large and heavy ones are
made weighing 40 to 50 pounds.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Washboards.</span>—There are fifty or more varieties of these “Monday
Morning Pianos.” Metal scrubbers are preferred to wood,
which is liable to splinter, wound the fingers, and tear the clothes.
And a plain crimp is better for fabrics than a rougher crimp, although
the latter may extract the dirt quicker. A favorite variety
have adjustable chest protectors. <span class='sc'>Clothes pins</span> are of two kinds,
the old fashioned and the spring clasp. The latter are little used.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mops.</span>—There are two kinds in the stores; one of twisted twine,
which is generally thought to be most durable, the other of cotton
and less expensive.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><span class='sc'>Stove Polish.</span>—This is chiefly plumbago or black lead.
Among the favorite brands are “<span class='sc'>Dixon</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Rising Sun</span>,” “A.
B. C.,” etc. There is also a liquid preparation or “Enamel,” said
to give a good polish without dust or smell, and with little
labor.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Blacking.</span>—The best is that which will, without injury to the
leather, most easily and quickly give a handsome and durable
polish. Besides the excellent domestic varieties, there are the
French Marcerou, and Jacquot’s, in tin boxes, which are reliable
and but little more expensive, and the old time Day &amp; Martin’s
blacking in stone jugs. For ladies’ use there are many domestic
and imported <span class='fss'>SHOE DRESSINGS</span> in liquid form, which require no
rubbing.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Matches.</span>—Common sulphur matches are made both square and
round, and come packed in various kinds of boxes and papers.
<span class='sc'>Parlor matches</span>, of American, Swedish, and other foreign manufacture,
are made without sulphur; and chloride of potash, antimony,
etc., are often used instead of phosphorus. The splints are
sometimes soaked in oil or paraffine to make them burn freely. <span class='sc'>Safety
Matches</span> have the phosphorus on sand paper and the other materials
on the ends of the splints, and neither can be ignited except
by friction with the other. There are many kinds of <span class='fss'>WAX
TAPERS</span>, “<span class='sc'>Flaming Lights</span>,” etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Seeds.</span>—The raising of seeds has become a large industry.
Leading producers make careful tests of all their seeds, and even
offer valuable prizes for the best vegetables and flowers grown
from them. Some grocers lay in every season a fresh and full
supply of all the seeds used in the garden or field, and they are
almost always reliable.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Birdseed</span>, <span class='sc'>Food</span>, <span class='fss'>ETC.</span>—Canary seed comes both in bulk and
pound packages, either alone or mixed with millet, German rape
seed, etc.; many packages contain a piece of cuttle fish bone.
There are <span class='fss'>BIRD GRAVEL</span>, <span class='fss'>BIRD PEPPER</span>, <span class='fss'>MOCKING BIRD FOOD</span> in
bottles, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Insect Powder.</span>—There are a number of these vegetable preparations
which are effective, if genuine and unadulterated, as the
<span class='sc'>Persian</span>, <span class='sc'>Buhach</span> (or Californian), <span class='sc'>Dalmatian</span>, etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Disinfectants.</span>—Chloride of Lime in various sized packages of
tin and paper, and various liquid preparations in bottles and kegs,
are put up for domestic use.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Pails.</span>—Ordinary water pails have either 2 or 3 hoops. Those
not painted on the inside are preferred. Wood pulp pails give
good satisfaction, and a new pail with sunken hoops is just coming
into market.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Grocers’ Sundries.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Among other articles sometimes kept by the grocer, may be
mentioned: Irish Moss, Anatto and other butter colorings, Licorice,
Chewing Gum, Fruit Juices, Hops, Rennet, Ink, Paper and

  <h2 class='c011'>WINES AND LIQUORS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>While there are some grocers who, for various reasons do not
handle these products, there are also many who keep for the
family use of their customers a full line of choice wines, malt
beverages, and distilled liquors. This work would therefore be
incomplete without reference to these articles, and it is believed
that the few facts given below concerning them will be found
interesting and instructive.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>WINES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Pure wine is merely grape juice fermented. When the sugar
of the grape is wholly or nearly converted by fermentation into
natural vinous spirits or alcohol, the result is a <span class='fss'>STILL</span> or <span class='fss'>DRY
WINE</span>. If the sugar is very abundant, as in overripe grapes, and
a considerable portion of it remains unfermented, a <span class='fss'>SWEET WINE</span>
like Tokay or Malmsey is produced. When fermentation has proceeded
to a certain stage and the liquid is bottled, so that it continues
to ferment and produce carbonic acid gas, the result is an
effervescent wine, as <span class='fss'>SPARKLING CHAMPAGNE</span>. If, during fermentation,
the process be arrested by the addition of alcohol, certain
vegetable substances are retained in the liquid, and such wines as
<span class='fss'>PORT</span> and <span class='fss'>SHERRY</span> are the product.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Composition of Wines.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Wines, as well as all varieties of malt and spirituous liquors, owe
their intoxicating qualities to alcohol. But the medical and dietetic
qualities of wine are not solely due to it; a mixture of water
and alcohol, or whiskey of equal strength, has a very different
effect on the animal economy. Pure wines contain also natural
acids, sugar, ethers, albumen, phosphates, etc. Their value is,
however, mainly determined by their “Bouquet” or flavor, produced
by substances natural to the grapes, heightened and rendered
more delicate by fermentation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
<h3 class='c022'>Alcohol and Acids in Wine.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The quantity of alcohol in natural wine from grapes, varies
between 5 and 12 per cent.; the quantity of free acid from 3 to 7
per cent. If more of the latter be present, the wine tastes excessively
sour, and is less easily digested; but some acid in wine
is essential, and contributes much to its flavor and virtues. Besides
the natural acids which exist in the juice of the grape, cheap
and inferior wines often contain, also, the hurtful acids of spoiling,
showing the approach to vinegar.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>WINES OF THE WORLD.</h3>

<h4 class='c022'>France.</h4>

<p class='c023'>Even a bird’s-eye glance at the wines of the world, might easily
fill a volume. There are the superb French wines of Burgundy
and Champagne, which ancient Provinces are now almost one
splendid, continuous vineyard; and the Clarets, Sauternes, etc.
of Bordeaux and <a id='tn062'></a>Languedoc. Medoc and Haut Medoc are known
to wine lovers everywhere, for here are the famous vineyards
of the Chateau Lafitte, owned by Baron Rothschild; the Chateaux
<a id='tn062-2'></a>Margaux, Latour, and many others.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>The Wines of Germany.</h4>

<p class='c023'>The principal wine districts of Germany are the valleys of the
Rhine and Moselle and their tributaries, whence come the well
known Hock and the red and white wines, which, though sometimes
rather thin and deficient in flavor, are never colored, plastered,
boiled, or have spirits added to them, and are therefore
natural and wholesome. Here also is the renowned Johannisberg
Castle vineyard, owned by the family of Prince Meternich. Every
bottle of this wine bears his family arms, and it is the beverage of
Emperors and Kings. By reason of its exquisite “Bouquet” it is
pronounced “The finest and costliest drink on earth.”</p>

<h4 class='c022'>Wines of Hungary, Italy, Spain, etc.</h4>

<p class='c023'>Hungary sends forth her “Imperial” opal-tinted Tokay wines,
made of overripe grapes, from which the juices are never squeezed
but allowed to drop; other Hungarian wines are as dry as those of
France, as mellow as those of Germany, and more fragrant than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the choicest of Spain. Italy, Spain and Portugal produce wines
of much repute, but neither of the latter two countries make
sparkling wines; they supply Sherry and Port which generally have
spirits added to them.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>American Wines.</h4>

<p class='c023'>The wines of California and other sections of the United States
are rapidly rising in popular estimation, and the time is probably
not far distant when they will rival those of any part of the world.
The consumption of domestic vintages increases with the constant
improvement in their quality, which follows the slowly acquired
knowledge, as to the best methods of turning the luscious juices
of our own abundant grapes into wine.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>Champagne.</h4>

<p class='c023'>The French make four varieties of champagne, viz.: <span class='sc'>Non-Mousseux</span>,
<span class='sc'>Cremant</span>, <span class='sc'>Mousseux</span>, and <span class='sc'>Grand-Mousseux</span>. The first
is fully fermented wine, fined, drawn into bottles, and allowed to
rest a long time. <span class='sc'>Cremant</span> is moderately sparkling. <span class='sc'>Mousseux</span>
throws out its cork with an audible report and begins gently to
overflow. <span class='sc'>Grand-Mousseux</span> pops out the cork with a loud
noise and overflows with much foam, as it has the pressure of five
atmospheres. A sound, rather dry champagne is said to be one
of the best of remedies for impaired digestion.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>Good and Poor Champagne.</h4>

<p class='c023'>Good champagne throws up for a long time after being opened
a continuous stream of small, sparkling bubbles of gas:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Each sunset ray, that mixed by chance</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With the wine’s diamond, showed</div>
      <div class='line'>How sunbeams may be taught to dance.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Even after hours of exposure, when it has lost all its excess of
carbonic acid, good champagne still retains the characteristic flavor
of true wine, while an inferior sparkling wine becomes, after
exposure, almost as insipid as a mixture of sugar and water. The
best are made from the first pressings of the grape. Those made
from a third, fourth or fifth pressing require the addition of sugar
and are cloying and far inferior in flavor. Imitation champagnes
are made by sweetening any ordinary still wines or cider
and charging them with carbonic acid gas.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
<h3 class='c022'>MALT LIQUORS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Malt liquors, properly so called, should be made only of malted
barley, hops, yeast and water, but other materials are also used.
<span class='sc'>Porter</span> is a beer of a high percentage of alcohol and made from
malt dried at a high temperature, which gives it its dark color.
<span class='sc'>Ale</span> is pale beer with considerable alcohol and made of pale malt,
with more hop extract than porter.</p>

<p class='c021'>As every per cent. of sugar in the malt yields by fermentation
about half a per cent. of alcohol, it is evident that ale, porter, and
lager beer are stronger or weaker, as more or less malt is used in
making them.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>ALCOHOL IN BEERS.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Beers</span> are stimulating from their alcohol and refreshing from
their carbonic acid, besides being tonic and somewhat nutritive.
The oil of the hops gives them aroma and the lupulin they contain
soothes the nerves. Their taste is vinous, sweetish, and bitter at the
same time. The quantity of alcohol in malt liquors was given by
Prof. Englehardt, as the result of analyses made for the N. Y.
State Board of Health, in 1885, as follows.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Beer Adulterations.</h3>

<p class='c023'>It has been popularly supposed that beer is much adulterated.
But the result of many analyses made by Mr. C. A. Crampton, for
the Department of Agriculture at Washington, last year, show
him “That beer is as free from adulteration as most other articles
of consumption, and more so than some.” The analyst found
that, practically, no foreign bitters other than hops were used;
but he also found that nearly one quarter of the samples analyzed
contained, as a preservative, the <a id='tn064'></a>unwholesome salicylic acid. This
powerful drug is also largely used in the manufacture of cheap
wines, etc., and the practice should be rigidly prohibited.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Ginger Ale</span> is made by fermenting sweetened water, to which
extract of ginger has been added, to such a degree as to generate
carbonic acid gas and become effervescent. It is a <a id='tn065'></a>healthful and
agreeable beverage, containing some alcohol and being slightly
stimulant.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Good Cider</span> contains 3 to 5 per cent. of alcohol. It is made
from the fermented juice of apples. Many grown people acquired
their fondness for cider on the “Old Farm” in childhood. It is
sold by grocers in bulk, and is also bottled extensively and sold as
“Champagne cider,” and quite often as champagne.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>DISTILLED LIQUORS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The disagreeable taste of freshly distilled ardent spirits is
due to the presence of fusil oil and other empyreumatic substances,
which time alone can transform into harmless ethers which smell
and taste agreeably, and produce an exhilaration over and above
that of the alcohol which holds them in solution. Spirits can be
distilled from any vegetable matter which will yield alcohol, yet
many substances yield only a rasping, nauseous or flavorless liquor,
which age does not improve. To some of these products, artificial
flavors and color are given and the imitation articles are thus
placed on the market. But true whiskey, brandy, etc., have a
specific and original flavor of their own, and contain vegetable
oils and acids.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Alcohol in Liquors.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The following table shows the proportion of alcohol (by volume)
in the various liquors.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Brandy.</span>—This is made from wine; that from white grapes is
preferred and it requires about seven bottles of wine to make one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of brandy. Even the best <a id='tn066'></a>Cognac is burning and rough until kept
for two or three years, and it improves with increased age, until,
when thirty or forty years old, it develops a flavor somewhat
similar to that of vanilla.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Whiskey</span> is a spirit distilled either from fermented malt, rye,
barley, oats, wheat or corn. The very best and sweetest grain is
only used for making good whiskey. American whiskey is more
easily obtained pure than perhaps any spirituous liquor and is
therefore more reliable in this country. The name whiskey is a
corruption of the Erse and Irish word <i>Usquebaugh</i>, “Water of Life,”
the French <i>Eau de Vie</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Rum</span> is made from distilled molasses and skimmings from the
boiling sugar.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Gin</span> is distilled from unmalted grain, the product being rectified
and flavored with juniper berries.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>Favorite Brands.</h3>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
